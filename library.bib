   abstract = {Most efforts aimed at elucidating the factors responsible for the variation in species richness among different parasite communities have focused on host characteristics such as body mass or diet. Independently of host features, however, the way in which parasites use resources within the host may also affect the species richness of the community. The distribution of parasite individuals or biomass in niche space determines whether host resources are used evenly, or whether there are gaps in resource use, with some parts of the total niche being underutilized. Here, the concepts of functional richness and functional evenness are applied to parasite communities for the first time, using simple indices. Measurements of the distribution of species in niche space within communities, such as mapping the distribution of hel-minths along the length of the host's intestine, is standard practice in parasitology. In such cases, functional richness is simply the proportion of the total number of intestine sections available that are used by at least 1 worm, whereas functional evenness measures the evenness in the distribution of worm numbers or biomass across all niche sections that are occupied. Data on cestode communities of elasmobranchs are used to illustrate the use of these indices, and to show how important they can be in tests of ecological hypotheses. The indices presented here capture essential features of resource use in parasite communities, and can be useful tools for comparative analyses.},

   abstract = {One approach to the study of the structure of animal communities for which there is a considerable amount of raw data is the comparison of abundances of the species of a group of organisms in a given locality. The basic information is a list of species found and the abundance of each. This can best be plotted by ranking the species from commonest to rarest along the abscissa and plotting their abundances along the ordinate. For convenience, the abscissa is graduated logarithmically. Earlier investigations,' discussed elsewhere,2 fit known statistical curves of uncertain biological meaning to the data. A more fruitful approach seems to be to predict curves on the basis of simple biological hypotheses and to compare these with the data. Three such hypotheses will be discussed here. First, however, the evidence cited by Lack,3 combined with the observation that censuses yield similar results when taken in the same habitat either at the same time in different places or in the same place in different years, indicates, for birds at least, that the observed populations are not under the control of very local or rapid temporal processes; i.e., they are in a near-equilibrium state. The hypotheses will therefore be ones which yield an equilibrium or near-equilibrium population. Hypothesis 1: Nonoverlapping Niches. The environment is compared with a stick of unit length on which n-1 points are thrown at random. The stick is broken at these points, and the lengths of the n resulting segments are proportional to the abundances of the n species. This comparison is legitimate, since the mathematical part of the derivation can be used unchanged for spaces of higher dimension. The most complete discussion of the resulting distribution is given by Barton and David.4 The expected length of the rth shortest interval is given by (1/n) Z [1/(n-i + 1) ], so that the expected abundance of the rth rarest species r among n species and m individuals is (m/n) Z [1/(n-i + 1)]. This is plotted in Figure 1. Bird censuses from tropical forests5 and many temperate regions fit this hypothesis almost perfectly. Quite frequently, however, the resulting curve is too steep; i.e., common species are too abundant, rare species too rare. These steep curves can be duplicated by considering the community as composed of two sticks of very different lengths (totaling unit length), each broken randomly into n/2 pieces. This is easily generalized to communities which are composed of several smaller ones, each obeying the original hypothesis. These composite communities are heterogeneous. The divergence from the ideal curve may, in fact, be regarded on this hypothesis as a measure of heterogeneity. Experimentally , for bird communities, this appears to explain most of the "steep" curves. For example, the census of Quaker Run Valley in Pennsylvania6 yields a curve which is much too steep. When the censuses of the small pieces of the valley are plotted separately, they are in good agreement with the hypothesis. Some other populations of species, as of trees, do not seem to have this composite property and may require a different explanation.},

   abstract = {Entropies such as the Shannon-Wiener and Gini-Simpson indices are not themselves diversities. Conversion of these to effective number of species is the key to a unified and intuitive interpretation of diversity. Effective numbers of species derived from standard diversity indices share a common set of intuitive mathematical properties and behave as one would expect of a diversity, while raw indices do not. Contrary to Keylock, the lack of concavity of effective numbers of species is irrelevant as long as they are used as transformations of concave alpha, beta, and gamma entropies. The practical importance of this transformation is demonstrated by applying it to a popular community similarity measure based on raw diversity indices or entropies. The standard similarity measure based on untransformed indices is shown to give misleading results, but transforming the indices or entropies to effective numbers of species produces a stable, easily interpreted, sensitive general similarity measure. General overlap measures derived from this transformed similarity measure yield the Jaccard index, Sørensen index, Horn index of overlap, and the Morisita-Horn index as special cases.

This paper will review how the spatial structure of biological populations and communities can be studied. We first demonstrate that many of the basic statistical methods used in ecological studies are impaired by autocorrelated data. Most if not all environmental data fall in this category. We will look briefly at ways of performing valid statistical tests in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Methods now available for analysing the spatial structure of biological populations are described, and illustrated by vegetation data. These include various methods to test for the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the data: univariate methods (all-directional and two-dimensional spatial correlograms, and two-dimensional spectral analysis), and the multivariate Mantel test and Mantel correlogram; other descriptive methods of spatial structure: the univariate variogram, and the multivariate methods of clustering with spatial contiguity constraint; the partial Mantel test, presented here as a way of studying causal models that include space as an explanatory variable; and finally, various methods for mapping ecological variables and producing either univariate maps (interpolation, trend surface analysis, kriging) or maps of truly multivariate data (produced by constrained clustering). A table shows the methods classified in terms of the ecological questions they allow to resolve. Reference is made to available computer programs.},

   abstract = {In the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest (AF), amphibians (625 species) face habitat degradation leading to stressful thermal conditions that constrain animal activity (e.g., foraging and reproduction). Data on thermal ecology for these species are still scarce. We tested the hypothesis that environmental occupation affects the thermal tolerance of amphibian species more than their phylogenetic relationships. We evaluated patterns of thermal tolerance of 47 amphibian species by assessing critical thermal maxima and warming tolerances, relating these variables with ecological covariates (e.g., adult macro- and microhabitat and site of larval development). We used mean and maximum environmental temperature, ecological covariates, and morphological measurements in the phylogenetic generalized least squares model selection to evaluate which traits better predict thermal tolerance. We did not recover phylogenetic signal under a Brownian model; our results point to a strong association between critical thermal maxima and habitat and development site. Forest species were less tolerant to warm temperatures than open area or generalist species. Species with larvae that develop in lentic environment were more tolerant than those in lotic ones. Thus, species inhabiting forest microclimates are more vulnerable to the synergistic effect of habitat loss and climate change. We use radar charts as a quick evaluation tool for thermal risk diagnoses using aspects of natural history as axes.},

Ponds are an important amphibian habitat in the study area and many have been stocked with fish. Surveys conducted over three years were used to construct amphibian species lists for individual ponds. Species richness and presence/ absence were compared among ponds classified by the type offish present. Amphibian species richness was significantly lower at ponds having predatory fish present than at non-predatory, or fish-free, ponds. Not all amphibian species were negatively affected by the presence of predatory fish: those having either large bodies or clutch size co-occurred with predatory fish more frequently than those with small bodies or clutch size.

   abstract = {Question: Temperate grasslands are known for their high plant diversity and distinct seasonality. However, their intra-annual community dynamics are still largely overlooked by ecologists. Therefore, we explored the seasonal alpha- and beta-diversity patterns of vascular plants and their relationships to above-ground biomass in a rocky steppe (Festucion valesiacae). Location: Pavlov Hills, SE Czech Republic. Methods: For one year, we monitored the plant community of the rocky steppe at monthly intervals in 42 permanent plots of 0.25 m2. We examined seasonal changes in above-ground biomass (estimated from the cover and height of living plant parts) and seasonal beta-diversity, which we partitioned into turnover and nestedness components and their quantitative counterparts: balanced changes and abundance gradients. Results: We identified a pronounced seasonal pattern of above-ground biomass, species richness and composition. Total above-ground biomass was highest in June (summer), with a peak representing only 60% of total annual production (sum of individual species' maxima). However, the observed peak in species richness occurred in March (early spring), with 80% of the total species number recorded throughout the year. Accordingly, nestedness and abundance gradient patterns differed in the spring months, while seasonal turnover and balanced changes in abundance were generally congruent. Annual, short-lived, and perennial species exhibited different seasonal patterns of species richness and biomass production, although a sharp increase in biomass and a peak in species richness in spring were universal across the community. Conclusions: Seasonal climatic constraints on plant growth are key determinants of primary production dynamics. Plants adapt to these constraints by adjusting their life cycles in different ways. In dry grasslands, the complexity of plant responses to climatic seasonality can result in seasonal beta-diversity patterns with divergent peaks in biomass and species richness.},

Understanding how species diversity and their functions are affected by these changes is crucial to assess environmental impacts. In this work, we aim to understand how lizard composition, taxonomic and functional diversity respond to differences in native vegetation regeneration stages (conserved vegetation and open secondary vegetation) and agricultural land use in different vegetation types (Caatinga sensu stricto, Cerrado sensu stricto and Relictual Humid Forest) in Caatinga domain, Brazil. In more degraded areas (open secondary vegetation and agricultural areas), we found a decline in species evenness, shown by greater dominance of few species. Moreover, we found a lower functional evenness in agricultural areas than in areas of conserved vegetation, which suggests that a smaller portion of functional traits present greater dominance in more anthropized areas. We did not detect any significant differences in species richness, but we did registered differences in species composition in Relictual Humid Forest. Contrary to our expectations, lizard abundance was also greater in more degraded areas, probably as a result of the increased abundance of species benefited by anthropization. In this work, we advance the knowledge of how anthropogenic changes influence lizard diversity and emphasize the importance of analysing different facets of diversity and different habitat environments to understand how anthropization affects patterns in community ecology.},

In this study, the feeding habits of three species of anurans (Rhinella fernandezae, Odontophrynus americanus and Physalaemus albonotatus) were compared between a soybean field and a native forest in Santa Fe Province, Argentina. Our dietary assessment is based on 124 individuals (47 R. fernandezae, 45 O. americanus and 32 P. albonotatus). Lepidopteran larvae were the predominant item in anuran diets from the soybean field, whereas collembola, isopods and snails prevailed in the diets from forests. Generally, the three anuran species shifted their diets as prey differs in the two environments, but R. fernandezae and P. albonotatus maintained a preference for a few prey types. Mean niche overlap in the soybean field was smaller than expected by chance, suggesting that the three anuran species are competing for limited resources. Trophic studies on other native anurans in agroecosystems should be a priority in conservation efforts due to their potential use as natural control agents, as well as for assessing the consequences of the broad conversion of natural forest to agricultural use in our region and throughout the world.},

   abstract = {Habitat fragmentation and infectious diseases threaten wildlife globally, but the interactions of these threats are poorly understood. For instance, while habitat fragmentation can impact genetic diversity at neutral loci, the impacts on disease-relevant loci are less well-studied. We examined the effects of habitat fragmentation in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest on amphibian genetic diversity at an immune locus related to antigen presentation and detection (MHC IIB Exon 2). We used a custom high-throughput assay to sequence a fragment of MHC IIB and quantified Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) infections in six frog species in two Atlantic Forest regions. Habitat fragmentation was associated with genetic erosion at MHC IIB Exon 2. This erosion was most severe in forest specialists. Significant Bd infections were detected only in one Atlantic Forest region, potentially due to relatively higher elevation. In this region, forest specialists showed an increase in both Bd prevalence and infection loads in fragmented habitats. Reduced population-level MHC IIB diversity was associated with increased Bd infection risk. On the individual level, MHC IIB heterozygotes exhibited a trend toward reduced Bd infection risk, although this was marginally non-significant. Our results suggest that habitat fragmentation increases Bd infection susceptibility in amphibians, mediated at least in part through erosion of immunogenetic diversity. Our findings have implications for management of fragmented populations in the face of emerging infectious diseases.},

   abstract = {The use of acoustic signals is a common characteristic of most anuran species to mediate intraspecific communication. Besides many social purposes, one of the main functions of these signals is species recognition. For this reason, this phenotypic trait is normally applied to taxonomy or to construct evolutionary relationship hypotheses. Here the acoustic repertoire of five populations of the genus Allobates from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest are presented for the first time, on a vulnerable to extinction Neotropical taxon. The description of males’ advertisement and aggressive calls and a female call emitted in a courtship context are presented. In addition, the advertisement calls of individuals from distinct geographical regions were compared. Differences in frequency range and note duration may imply in taxonomic rearrangements of these populations, once considered distinct species, and more recently, proposed as a single species, Allobates olfersioides. Calls of the male from the state of Rio de Janeiro do not overlap spectrally with calls of males from northern populations, while the shorter notes emitted by males from Alagoas also distinguishes this population from the remaining southern populations. Therefore, it is likely that at least two of the junior synonyms should be revalidated. Similarities among male advertisement and female calls are generally reported in other anuran species; these calls may have evolved from a preexisting vocalization common to both sexes. Male aggressive calls were different from both the male advertisement and female calls, since it was composed by a longer and multi-pulsed note. Aggressive and advertisement calls generally have similar dominant frequencies, but they have temporal distinctions. Such patterns were corroborated with the Atlantic Forest Rocket Frogs. These findings may support future research addressing the taxonomy of the group, behavioral evolution, and amphibian conservation.},

   abstract = {Human actions are altering ecosystems worldwide. Among human-released pollutants, ionizing radiation arises as a rare but potentially devastating threat to natural systems. The Chornobyl accident (1986) represents the largest release of radioactive material to the environment. Our aim was to examine how exposure to radiation from the Chornobyl accident influences dorsal skin coloration of Eastern tree frog (Hyla orientalis) males sampled across a wide gradient of radioactive contamination in northern Ukraine. We assessed the relationship between skin frog coloration (which can act as a protective mechanism against ionizing radiation), radiation conditions and oxidative stress levels. Skin coloration was darker in localities closest to areas with high radiation levels at the time of the accident, whereas current radiation levels seemed not to influence skin coloration in Chornobyl tree frogs. Tree frogs living within the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone had a remarkably darker dorsal skin coloration than frogs from outside the Zone. The maintenance of dark skin coloration was not linked to physiological costs in terms of frog body condition or oxidative status, and we did not detect short-term changes in frog coloration. Dark coloration is known to protect against different sources of radiation by neutralizing free radicals and reducing DNA damage, and, particularly melanin pigmentation has been proposed as a buffering mechanism against ionizing radiation. Our results suggest that exposure to high levels of ionizing radiation, likely at the time of the accident, may have been selected for darker coloration in Chornobyl tree frogs. Further studies are needed to determine the underlying mechanisms and evolutionary consequences of the patterns found here.},

The aim of this study was to assess species richness and natural history attributes of the snakes of an assemblage in the Restinga, Tabuleiro and Forest environments of the Atlantic Forest of the south coast of Paraíba, northeastern Brazil. A total of 151 individuals of 27 species, 23 genera, and six families of snakes were found. The most effective sampling methods were time-constrained searches and incidental encounters. Species sampled most frequently were the blindsnake Epictia borapeliotes, the Boa Constrictor Boa constrictor, the Brown Vinesnake Oxybelis aeneus, and the Brazilian False Coral Snake Oxyrhopus trigeminus. The snake fauna is characterized mainly by terrestrial species found in open-area environments of Restinga and Tabuleiro, and with most species feeding on amphibians and small mammals. The rarefaction curve did not reach the asymptote and new species should be recorded for south coast of Paraíba in future studies. Despite the richness and composition of snakes of the south coast being similar to other areas in the state, there is a lack of some species typically linked to forests, and this is probably because of the high level of deforestation that the south area of the state has suffered.},

Observations during 3 months in 2006 ascertained intra-seasonal site fidelity for males and females. Males actively defend large multi-purpose territories whereas females retreat to small resting sites from where they commute to neighbouring males for courtship and mating. Female short-term movement corroborates the previous assumption of a polygynous or promiscuous resource-defence mating system. Year-to-year recaptures from 2005 until 2008 revealed distinct patterns of inter-annual movement for males and regional site fidelity for females. Males abandon their territories and have to re-negotiate them when reproduction starts again at the end of the dry season. Females are not subject to intra- or inter-sexual territorial competition and as a result move significantly less between reproductive seasons than males. Male long-term movement reflects spatial structure and prevailing social interactions and is a reliable indicator for tadpole deposition sites. The combined effects of intra- and inter-seasonal movement promote the diversity of mates for both sexes. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of untidy datasets.

   abstract = {Provisioning of wildlife with food, water and breeding sites is a globally ubiquitous phenomenon. While some provisioning is targeted at single species of conservation concern, generalised provisioning is more common and can exceed the local availability of natural resources for recipient taxa. Generalised provisioning is enthusiastically promoted by many conservation organisations as a means to foster connection with nature and help wildlife. However, such a vast input of additional resources into the environment must have diverse, ecosystem-wide consequences. Direct effects upon recipient taxa have garnered most research interest, and are generally positive in leading to increased survival, productivity and hence population growth. However, we argue that the wider implications for the recipients' non-provisioned competitors, prey and predators are underappreciated and have the potential to generate pervasive negative impacts for biodiversity. The impact of provisioning has also hitherto been considered predominantly in urban contexts, overlooking the movements of wildlife to and from provisioning sources and the widespread nature of both human settlements and provisioning, underappreciating the potential scale of impact. Using a case study of UK garden bird food and nestbox provisioning, we hypothesise how well-intentioned provisioning could be contributing to widespread ecological community change and homogenisation. This may consequently help drive declines in species of conservation concern by asymmetrically benefitting common and adaptable species, leaving their competitors exposed to enhanced direct competition, hyperpredation, mesopredator release and heightened disease transmission risks. We recommend further research into these ecosystem cascades and a more cautious, evidence-based approach to the encouragement of provisioning wildlife.},

   abstract = {As ecosystems face disruption of community dynamics and habitat loss, the idea of determining ahead of time which species can become extinct is an important subject in conservation biology. A species’ vulnerability to extinction is dependent upon both intrinsic (life-history strategies, genetics) and extrinsic factors (environment, anthropogenic threats). Studies linking intrinsic traits to extinction risk have shown variable results, and to our knowledge, there has not been a systematic analysis looking at how demographic patterns in stage-specific survival and reproductive rates correlate to extinction risk. We used matrix projection models from the COMPADRE and COMADRE matrix databases and IUCN Red List status as our proxy of extinction risk to investigate if some demographic patterns are more vulnerable to extinction than others. We obtained data on demographic rates, phylogeny, and IUCN status for 159 species of herbaceous plants, trees, mammals, and birds. We calculated 14 demographic metrics related to different aspects of life history and elasticity values and analyzed whether they differ based on IUCN categories using conditional random forest analysis and phylogenetic generalized least square regressions. We mapped all species within the database, both with IUCN assessment and without, and overlaid them with biodiversity hotspots to investigate if there is bias within the assessed species and how many of the non-assessed species could use the demographic information recorded in COMPADRE and COMADRE for future IUCN assessments. We found that herbaceous perennials are more vulnerable when they mature early and have high juvenile survival rates; birds are more vulnerable with high progressive growth and reproduction; mammals are more vulnerable when they have longer generation times. These patterns may be used to assess relative vulnerability across species when lacking abundance or trend data.},

Yet, temperate species are facing more frequent and intense droughts as a result of climate change. Here, we examined variation in field hydration state (plasma osmolality) and standardized evaporative water loss rate (SEWL) of adult male and pregnant female common lizards (Zootoca vivipara) from 13 natural populations with contrasting air temperature, air humidity, and access to water. We found different patterns of geographic variation between sexes. Overall, males were more dehydrated (i.e. higher osmolality) than pregnant females, which likely comes from differences in field behaviour and water intake since the rate of SEWL was similar between sexes. Plasma osmolality and SEWL rate were positively correlated with environmental temperature in males, while plasma osmolality in pregnant females did not correlate with environmental conditions, reproductive stage or reproductive effort. The SEWL rate was significantly lower in populations without access to free standing water, suggesting that lizards can adapt or adjust physiology to cope with habitat dryness. Environmental humidity did not explain variation in water balance. We suggest that geographic variation in water balance physiology and behaviour should be taken account to better understand species range limits and sensitivity to climate change.},

The purpose is to decompose the ecological niche into subniches associated with the experimental design, i.e., taking into account temporal and/or spatial subsets. WitOMI emphasize the habitat conditions that contribute (1) to the definition of species' niches using all available conditions and, at the same time, (2) to the delineation of species' subniches according to given subsets of dates or sites. The latter aspect allows addressing niche dynamics by highlighting the influence of atypical habitat conditions on species at a given time and/or space. Then, (3) the biological constraint exerted on the species subniche becomes observable within Euclidean space as the difference between the existing fundamental subniche and the realized subniche. We illustrate the decomposition of published OMI analyses, using spatial and temporal examples. The species assemblage's subniches are comparable to the same environmental gradient, producing a more accurate and precise description of the assemblage niche distribution under environmental change.

In the face of ongoing climate change, determining how physiological traits structure species’ ranges is especially important in tropical montane systems. In this study, we ask whether thermal sensitivity in physiological performance restricts montane lizards to high elevations and excludes them from the warmer environments reported at low elevations. For three montane lizard species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we collect thermophysiological data from lizards in the highest elevation site of each species’ distribution, and ask how well the individuals exhibiting those traits would perform across the Atlantic Forest. We use microclimatic and organism-specific models to directly relate environmental conditions to an organism's body temperature and physiological traits, and estimate measures of thermophysiological performance. Our findings demonstrate that thermophysiological constraints do not restrict montane lizards to high elevations in this system, and thus likely do not determine the warm boundaries of these montane species’ distributions. Results also suggest that competition may be important in limiting the warm boundaries of the species’ ranges for two of the focal species. These experimental results suggest that caution should be used when claiming that physiology drives patterns of diversity and endemism within montane environments. They also highlight the importance of interdisciplinary experimental studies that bridge the fields of evolution and ecology to improve predictions of biological responses to future environmental shifts.},

   abstract = {New insights into the natural world are just a few of the results from the use of fractal geometry. Examples from population and landscape ecology are used to illustrate the usefulness of fractal geometry to the field of ecology. The advent of the computer age played an important role in the development and acceptance of fractal geometry as a valid new discipline. New insights gained from the application of fractal geometry to ecology include: understanding the importance of spatial and temporal scales; the relationship between landscape structure and movement pathways; an increased understanding of landscape structures; and the ability to more accurately model landscapes and ecosystems. Using fractal dimensions allows ecologists to map animal pathways without creating an unmanageable deluge of information. Computer simulations of landscapes provide useful models for gaining new insights into the coexistence of species. Although many ecologists have found fractal geometry to be an extremely useful tool, not all concur. With all the new insights gained through the appropriate application of fractal geometry to natural sciences, it is clear that fractal geometry a useful and valid tool. New insight into the natural world is just one of the results of the increasing popularity and use of fractal geometry in the last decade. What are fractals and what are they good for? Scientists in a variety of disciplines have been trying to answer this question for the last two decades. Physicists, chemists, mathematicians, biologists, computer scientists, and medical researchers are just a few of the scientists that have found uses for fractals and fractal geometry. Ecologists have found fractal geometry to be an extremely useful tool for describing ecological systems. Many population, community, ecosystem, and landscape ecologists use fractal geometry as a tool to help define and explain the systems in the world around us. As with any scientific field, there has been some dissension in ecology about the appropriate level of study. For example, some organism ecologists think that anything larger than a single organism obscures the reality with too much detail. On the other hand, some ecosystem ecologists believe that looking at anything less than an entire ecosystem will not give meaningful results. In reality, both perspectives are correct. Ecologists must take all levels of organization into account to get the most out of a study. Fractal geometry is a tool that bridges the "gap" between different fields of ecology and provides a common language. Fractal geometry has provided new insight into many fields of ecology. Examples from population and landscape ecology will be used to illustrate the usefulness of fractal geometry to the field of ecology. Some population ecologists use fractal geometry to correlate the landscape structure with movement pathways of populations or organisms, which greatly influences population and community ecology. Landscape ecologists tend to use fractal geometry to define, describe, and model the scale-dependent heterogeneity of the landscape structure. Before exploring applications of fractal geometry in ecology, we must first define fractal},

   abstract = {This paper considers the central tenet of the 'Econet Initiative' and the developing view of the structure and function of ecosystems and their essential emergence from ecological interactions at the level of individuals and populations. Most of what we consider to be community ecology is concerned with how individuals and species-specific populations respond to, smooth, or fail to accommodate, the consequences of inhabiting continuously variable environments. The essential principle is that individuals, populations, communities, systems, each build towards a definable, contemporaneous, habitat-specific supportive capacity, set by the resource base and the opportunities to process them. While both are amenable, interspecific competition is weak and many species may have the chance to raise their recruitment potential and build biomass, with the dynamic advantage going to the most efficient converters at every trophic level (r-vs. K-selection). As a result of the biomass expansion or of the independent diminution in opportunity or resource base, the special adaptations of disturbance-(R) or stress-(S) tolerant species allow them to glean survival under increasingly competitive strains. Persistent variability and renewal of growth opportunities make exclusion difficult and extinction is more a local than a regional consequence. Poorly competitive species survive through an ability to find new habitat patches 'released' by variability. Integration to larger geographical patterns gives the linkage to higher-order ecosystem behaviour. Some examples of contemporary ecological issues (latitude gradients, optimality, threshold behaviour and the maintenance of biodiversity) are reviewed in the context of systems behaviour.},

The package is written in the R language (R Development Core Team) and contains several features, unique in their implementation, that are complementary to other existing R packages. Pre-modeling analyses include species niche quantifications and comparisons between distinct ranges or time periods, measures of phylogenetic diversity, and other data exploration functionalities (e.g. extrapolation detection, ExDet). Core modeling brings together the new approach of ensemble of small models (ESM) and various implementations of the spatially-explicit modeling of species assemblages (SESAM) framework. Post-modeling analyses include evaluation of species predictions based on presence-only data (Boyce index) and of community predictions, phylogenetic diversity and environmentally-constrained species co-occurrences analyses. The ecospat package also provides some functions to supplement the ‘biomod2’ package (e.g. data preparation, permutation tests and cross-validation of model predictive power). With this novel package, we intend to stimulate the use of comprehensive approaches in spatial modelling of species and community distributions.},

Biota Neotrop., 8(3): http://www.biotaneotropica.org.br/v8n3/en/abstract?point-of-view+bn00108032008. Abstract: In Community Ecology and in many applications of Conservation Biology, diversity means variety of species, which may or not include information on the relative importance of each species. Diversity is one of the most important attributes in the study of communities and, as a result, many methods are available to its measurement. Among them, non-parametric diversity (or heterogeneity) indices such as Shannon and Simpson formulae are widely employed in a range of studies. These indices are composed of (or confound) two components, species richness and evenness. Different indices can be obtained combining the two components with different weights. The lack of an objective criteria to guide appropriate weighting of each component results in an arbitrary decision to use an index and not another. Additionally, depending on the weight the indices give to each component, an index may indicate that community A is more diversified than community B while a second index may indicate the contrary. Also, diversity indices applied to samples differing in species richness and evenness may produce similar values. Such problems can be avoided using alternative methods. One of them is diversity profile, which includes not one index but many diversity indices differing in the weight given to each component. Additional alternatives include the use of species richness only, Whittaker's diagram (or of dominance) and scatter diagrams with axes defined by species richness and an evenness index. Except by species richness, the cited alternative methods show graphically much more information than that contained in a single value produced by a diversity index. In studies requiring a response variable to be modeled in relation to predictor variables (Linear Models such as Regression and Analysis of Variance), I suggest the separate use of species richness and evenness as each one may reflect different aspect of communities.

Resumo: No contexto de Ecologia de Comunidades e em várias aplicações da Biologia da Conservação, diversidade indica variedade de espécies, podendo ou não incluir informações sobre a importância relativa de cada espécie. Diversidade é um dos atributos mais fundamentais no estudo de comunidades e para tal uma ampla gama de métodos para sua mensuração estão disponíveis. Entre eles destacam-se, pelo amplo uso, índices de diversidade não-paramétricos (ou de heterogeneidade) tais como os Índices de Shannon e Simpson. Estes índices consistem de (ou confundem) dois componentes, riqueza de espécies e equabilidade. Diferentes índices de diversidade podem ser obtidos combinando-se com diferentes pesos estes dois componentes. Dada a ausência de um critério objetivo na escolha destes pesos, o uso de um índice em detrimento de outro é muitas vezes arbitrário. Adicionalmente, visto o peso dado por cada índice de diversidade para cada um dos dois componentes, um dado índice pode indicar que a amostra A é mais diversa que a B, enquanto um outro índice pode indicar o contrário. Ainda, índices de diversidade aplicados sobre amostras diferindo em riqueza de espécies e equabilidade podem produzir o mesmo valor. Tais problemas podem ser contornados utilizando-se métodos alternativos. Um destes consiste no cálculo de perfis de diversidade, em que se calcula não apenas um mas vários índices de diversidade diferindo no peso dado a cada um dos componentes. Outras alternativas incluem o uso de riqueza de espécies apenas, diagrama de Whittaker (ou de dominância) e diagramas de dispersão com eixos definidos por riqueza de espécies e um índice de equabilidade. Com exceção de riqueza de espécies, as demais alternativas citadas mostram de forma gráfica muito mais informações do que aquela embutida num único valor obtido pela aplicação de um índice de diversidade. No caso de estudos em que se necessita de um valor resposta, a ser modelado segundo um ou mais preditores (Modelos Lineares tais como Regressão e Análise de Variância), uma sugestão é o uso separado de riqueza de espécies e de equabilidade.

   abstract = {Population Viability Analysis (PVA) is the estimation of extinction probabilities by analyses that incorporate identifiable threats to population survival into models of the extinction process. Extrinsic forces, such as habitat loss, over-harvesting, and competition or predation by introduced species, often lead to population decline. Although the traditional methods of wildlife ecology can reveal such deterministic trends, random fluctuations that increase as populations become smaller can lead to extinction even of populations that have, on average, positive population growth when below carrying capacity. Computer simulation modelling provides a tool for exploring the viability of populations subjected to many complex, interacting deterministic and random processes. One such simulation model, VORTEX, has been used extensively by the Captive Breeding Specialist Group (Species Survival Commission, IUCN), by wildlife agencies, and by university classes. The algorithms, structure, assumptions and applications of VORTEX are described in this paper. VORTEX models population processes as discrete, sequential events, with probabilistic outcomes. VORTEX simulates birth and death processes and the transmission of genes through the generations by generating random numbers to determine whether each animal lives or dies, to determine the number of progeny produced by each female each year, and to determine which of the two alleles at a genetic locus are transmitted from each parent to each offspring. Fecundity is assumed to be independent of age after an animal reaches reproductive age. Mortality rates are specified for each pre-reproductive age-sex class and for reproductive-age animals. Inbreeding depression is modelled as a decrease in viability in inbred animals. The user has the option of modelling density dependence in reproductive rates. As a simple model of density dependence in survival, a carrying capacity is imposed by a probabilistic truncation of each age class if the population size exceeds the specified carrying capacity. VORTEX can model linear trends in the carrying capacity. VORTEX models environmental variation by sampling birth rates, death rates, and the carrying capacity from binomial or normal distributions. Catastrophes are modelled as sporadic random events that reduce survival and reproduction for one year. VORTEX also allows the user to supplement or harvest the population, and multiple subpopulations can be tracked, with user-specified migration among the units. VORTEX outputs summary statistics on population growth rates, the probability of population extinction, the time to extinction, and the mean size and genetic variation in extant populations. VORTEX necessarily makes many assumptions. The model it incorporates is most applicable to species with low fecundity and long lifespans, such as mammals, birds and reptiles. It integrates the interacting effects of many of the deterministic and stochastic processes that have an impact on the viability of small populations, providing opportunity for more complete analysis than is possible by other techniques. PVA by simulation modelling is an important tool for identifying populations at risk of extinction, determining the urgency of action, and evaluating options for management.},

   abstract = {Fire is a powerful environmental disturbance with the ability to shape many biomes worldwide. However, global warming, land-use changes and other anthropogenic factors have strongly altered natural fire regimes worldwide. Despite the growing number of studies evaluating the effects of fire on biodiversity, little is understood about how burn affects certain groups that are particularly sensitive to climatic extremes, such as anurans. Here, we conducted a global and systematic literature review of studies assessing anurofauna responses to fire disturbances. We used Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models and theoretical information criteria to assess how fire affects anuran assemblages. We analyzed 68 studies, widely distributed in the globe, which examined the fire effects on abundance, richness and/or species behavior. In total, 191 species were considered, being Gastrophryne carolinensis and Lithobates catesbeianus the most evaluated. We reveal a lack of general anurofauna response to fire, as species and assemblages were either negatively or positively affected by burns. We observed that the fire treatments (Prescribed fire, Wildfire and without fire) and the biome where the study was conducted did not explain the variation in species abundance. Most studies were conducted in biomes classified as Temperate Forests, followed by Tropical Savannas and Tropical Forests. We highlight that future studies should consider factors associated to fire (e.g. fire treatment, fire properties), research design and species biology to explain patterns of species persistence and community structure. Although fire plays a key role in shaping several natural ecosystems, we have recently witnessed drastic changes in natural burning regimes all over the world, which imply leading to severe population reductions and even species extinctions. Given this scenario, government authorities should urgently support and invest in scientific studies that evaluate, monitor and test fire management practices in natural ecosystems and therefore establish mitigation actions to preserve the biota constantly threatened by the imbalance of this environmental disturbance.},

We provide a probabilistic derivation for the classic, incidence-based forms of these indices and extend this approach to formulate new Jaccard-type or Sørensen-type indices based on species abundance data. We then propose estimators for these indices that include the effect of unseen shared species, based on either (replicated) incidence- or abundance-based sample data. In sampling simulations, these new estimators prove to be considerably less biased than classic indices when a substantial proportion of species are missing from samples. Based on species-rich empirical datasets, we show how incorporating the effect of unseen shared species not only increases accuracy but also can change the interpretation of results.},

   abstract = {1. For biological community data (species-by-sample abundance matrices), Warwick and Clarke (1995) defined two biodiversity indices, capturing the structure not only of the distribution of abundances amongst species but also the taxonomic relatedness of the species in each sample. The first index, taxonomic diversity (Δ), can be thought of as the average taxonomic 'distance' between any two organisms, chosen at random from the sample: this distance can be visualized simply as the length of the path connecting these two organisms, traced through (say) a Linnean or phylogenetic classification of the full set of species involved. The second index, taxonomic distinctness (Δ*), is the average path length between any two randomly chosen individuals, conditional on them being from different species. This is equivalent to dividing taxonomic diversity, Δ, by the value it would take were thereto be no taxonomic hierarchy (all species belonging to the same genus). Δ* can therefore be seen as a measure of pure taxonomic relatedness, whereas Δ mixes taxonomic relatedness with the evenness properties of the abundance distribution. 2. This paper explores the statistical sampling properties of Δ and Δ*. Taxonomic diversity is seen to be a natural extension of a form of Simpson's index, incorporating taxonomic (or phylogenetic) information. Importantly for practical comparisons, both * and Δ* are shown not to be dependent, on average, on the degree of sampling effort involved in the data collection; this is in sharp contrast with those diversity measures that are strongly influenced by the number of observed species. 3. The special case where the data consist only of presence/absence information is dealt with in detail: Δ and Δ* converge to the same statistic (Δ+), which is now defined as the average taxonomic path length between any two randomly chosen species. Its lack of dependence, in mean value, on sampling effort implies that Δ+ can be compared across studies with differing and uncontrolled degrees of sampling effort (subject to assumptions concerning comparable taxonomic accuracy). This may be of particular significance for historic (diffusely collected) species lists from different localities or regions, which at first sight may seem unamenable to valid diversity comparison of any sort. 4. Furthermore, a randomization test is possible, to detect a difference in the taxonomic distinctness, for any observed set of species, from the 'expected' Δ+ value derived from a master species list for the relevant group of organisms. The exact randomization procedure requires heavy computation, and an approximation is developed, by deriving an appropriate variance formula. This leads to a 'confidence funnel' against which distinctness values for any specific area, pollution condition, habitat type, etc., can be checked, and formally addresses the question of whether a putatively impacted locality has a 'lower than expected' taxonomic spread. The procedure is illustrated for the UK species list of free-living marine nematodes and sets of samples from intertidal sites in two localities, the Exe estuary and the Firth of Clyde.},

   abstract = {Most efforts aimed at elucidating the factors responsible for the variation in species richness among different parasite communities have focused on host characteristics such as body mass or diet. Independently of host features, however, the way in which parasites use resources within the host may also affect the species richness of the community. The distribution of parasite individuals or biomass in niche space determines whether host resources are used evenly, or whether there are gaps in resource use, with some parts of the total niche being underutilized. Here, the concepts of functional richness and functional evenness are applied to parasite communities for the first time, using simple indices. Measurements of the distribution of species in niche space within communities, such as mapping the distribution of hel-minths along the length of the host's intestine, is standard practice in parasitology. In such cases, functional richness is simply the proportion of the total number of intestine sections available that are used by at least 1 worm, whereas functional evenness measures the evenness in the distribution of worm numbers or biomass across all niche sections that are occupied. Data on cestode communities of elasmobranchs are used to illustrate the use of these indices, and to show how important they can be in tests of ecological hypotheses. The indices presented here capture essential features of resource use in parasite communities, and can be useful tools for comparative analyses.},

   abstract = {Robert H. Whittaker defined beta diversity as the variation in species composition among sites in a geographic area. Beta diversity is a key concept for understanding the functioning of ecosystems, for the conservation of biodiversity, and for ecosystem management. This paper explains how hypotheses about the origin of beta diversity can be tested by partitioning the spatial variation of community composition data (presence-absence or abundance data) with respect to environmental variables and spatial base functions. We compare two statistical methods to accomplish that. The sum-of-squares of a community composition data table, which is one possible measure of beta diversity, is correctly partitioned by canonical ordination; hence, canonical partitioning produces correct estimates of the different portions of community composition variation. In recent years, several authors interested in the variation in community composition among sites (beta diversity) have used another method, variation partitioning on distance matrices (Mantel approach). Their results led us to compare the two partitioning approaches, using simulated data generated under hypotheses about the variation of community composition among sites. The theoretical developments and simulation results led to the following observations: (1) the variance of a community composition table is a measure of beta diversity. (2) The variance of a dissimilarity matrix among sites is not the variance of the community composition table nor a measure of beta diversity; hence, partitioning on distance matrices should not be used to study the variation in community composition among sites. (3) In all of our simulations, partitioning on distance matrices underestimated the amount of variation in community composition explained by the raw-data approach, and (4) the tests of significance had less power than the tests of canonical ordination. Hence, the proper statistical procedure for partitioning the spatial variation of community composition data among environmental and spatial components, and for testing hypotheses about the origin and maintenance of variation in community composition among sites, is canonical partitioning. The Mantel approach is appropriate for testing other hypotheses, such as the variation in beta diversity among groups of sites. Regression on distance matrices is also appropriate for fitting models to similarity decay plots. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {The article evaluates the dependence of the most common indices of species diversity on sample size and determines their ability to differentiate between different types of ecosystems, with a special emphasis on discriminating between natural and anthropogenic ecosystems. An approach to adjusting the indices to reduce their dependence on sample size was also proposed. The study was conducted in seven types of ecosystems: four were natural and three were anthropogenically transformed. Samples of soil animals were selected in 2011–2013 and 2021 using the same methods. A total of 20,518 soil animal specimens belonging to 202 species were collected in all study locations. The null alternative was generated by randomly selecting samples containing 2, 3, ..., 110 soil animals from the combined soil animal sample. For each gradation of sample size, 200 sample variants were formed. The density of soil macrofauna in natural ecosystems ranged from 3.6 ± 1.5 to 15.2 ± 6.9 specimens per sample, and in artificial ecosystems – from 13.2 ± 7.6 to 21.0 ± 11.9 specimens per sample. The number of species ranged from 22–80 species, and in artificial ecosystems it was 38–99 species. Indicators of species diversity correlated with each other. A high level of correlation was observed between indicators within groups of indices: indices of species richness and indices of heterogeneity and evenness. Fisher’s log-series alpha and the fundamental parameter of biodiversity were highly correlated with each other, as well as with the Margalef, species richness, and Chao’s species abundance indices. The log-normal distribution best describes the dominance patterns in terms of abundance in the natural ecosystems, and the Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution best describes the dominance patterns in terms of abundance in the artificial ecosystems. Diversity indices were ordered in the space of two dimensions, one explaining the variation between ecosystems and the other depending on sample size. The ordering of the traditional indices showed that there is a vacancy for the best index in the sense that such an index should best explain differences between ecosystems and differences between natural and artificial ecosystems. It should also be independent of sample size. The Simpson heterogeneity index and the Simpson evenness index were the best of the traditional indices, but they did not explain differences between ecosystems very well, especially when it came to distinguishing between natural and artificial ecosystems. The Margalef index, which is supposed to be independent of sample size, on the other hand, showed a very high level of dependence. Such a dependence was also found for the Menhinick index, though to a lesser extent. Obviously, size dependence negatively affects the differential ability of the indices. The corrected indices of species richness and the Shannon index are practically independent of sample size and have a greater ability to differentiate ecosystems by the level of diversity, with natural ecosystems characterized by consistently higher values of the corrected indices than artificial ecosystems. The dependence on the sample size makes indices from different ecosystems practically incomparable, which makes their use meaningless. Even minor differences in sample size can lead to significant deviations in the values of diversity indices. The application of the Michaelis-Menten model allowed us to suggest a method of correction of species richness indices and the Shannon index. After the correction, the indices are practically independent of the sample size, and their differential ability to characterize individual ecosystems and the level of anthropogenic transformation increases significantly.},

   abstract = {1. Indices quantifying the functional aspect of biodiversity are essential in understanding relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and environmental constraints. Many indices of functional diversity have been published but we lack consensus about what indices quantify, how redundant they are and which ones are recommended. 2. This study aims to build a typology of functional diversity indices from artificial data sets encompassing various community structures (different assembly rules, various species richness levels) and to identify a set of independent indices able to discriminate community assembly rules. 3. Our results confirm that indices can be divided into three main categories, each of these corresponding to one aspect of functional diversity: functional richness, functional evenness and functional divergence. Most published indices are highly correlated and quantify functional richness while quadratic entropy (Q) represents a mix between functional richness and functional divergence. Conversely, two indices (FEve and FDiv respectively quantifying functional evenness and functional divergence) are rather independent to all the others. The power analysis revealed that some indices efficiently detect assembly rules while others performed poorly. 4. To accurately assess functional diversity and establish its relationships with ecosystem functioning and environmental constraints, we recommend investigating each functional component separately with the appropriate index. Guidelines are provided to help choosing appropriate indices given the issue being investigated. 5. This study demonstrates that functional diversity indices have the potential to reveal the processes that structure biological communities. Combined with complementary methods (phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity), the multifaceted framework of functional diversity will help improve our understanding of how biodiversity interacts with ecosystem processes and environmental constraints. © 2010 The Authors.

   abstract = { Abstract. Dominance/diversity curves, displaying the relative abundances of the species within a community, have often been constructed from field data. Several ecological and statistical models of dominance/diversity have been proposed, to explain the curves. Yet, rarely have curves of different models been fitted to field data. In this paper the appropriate parameters and methods of curve fitting for plant communities are described for the General Lognormal, Canonical Lognormal, Geometric, Broken Stick, Zipf and Zipf‐Mandelbrot models. Distinction is made between fixed and optimised parameters, to clarify para‐meterisation of the models. It is concluded that all should be fitted by minimising the deviance in a ranked‐abundance plot.Statistical tests of goodness of fit are discussed. It is concluded that consistency of fit between replicate quadrats of a community provide the best test.Curves of all the models discussed are fitted to data from a species‐rich Spanish hay meadow, and to data from a New Zealand intertidal algal community. The Spanish meadow data are best fitted by General Lognormal. The New Zealand algal data are best fitted by Geometric or General Lognormal. Goodness of fit for a sample is usually relatively good or poor for all models, since much of the deviance comes from steps in the curve which none of the models can fit closely.},

   abstract = {A new instrument called a "spherical densiometer" has been described for estimating forest overstory density. 2 This pocket-type instrument employs a mirror with spherical curvature which makes possible the reflection of a large overhead area. A grid is used to estimate percentage of this overhead area covered with forest canopy. Estimation is usually from a point near the forest floor. Adequate sampling gives the average canopy of a forest area. Two models, A and B (Figures 1 and 2), have been adopted as standard. Each employs a highly polished chrome mirror 21/2 inches in diameter and having the curvature of a 6 inch sphere. The convex side of the mirror is used in Model A and the concave side in Model B. Each has some advantages over the other. The mirrors are mounted in small wooden recessed boxes with hinged lids similar to compass boxes. The overall dimensions are about 31/2 x 31/2 x 11/8 inches. A circular spirit level is mounted (recessed) beside the mirrors. Positive slide fasteners are provided in Model B which allow the lid to open to an angle of about 45 degrees. Cross-shaped and circular grids with squares and dots are used to estimate overstory coverage by tree crowns. Grids are of two kinds: (1) those scratched upon the surface of the mirror (Model A), and (2) those superimposed between the mirror and the eye (Model B). The cross-shaped grid scratched upon the convex surface of the mirror in Model A has 24 quarter-inch squares (Figure 3A). Instructions for using the densiometer and cumulative values for the squares on the grid are shown on a chart that is attached to the inside of the box lid (Figure 3B). It is easier and faster to estimate the relative amount of overstory coverage with this instrument by assuming the presence of four equi-spaced dots in each square and by counting dots representing openings in the canopy. The percentage of overstory density is then assumed to be the complement of this number. Each assumed dot is assigned a value of one percent in this case. A slight discrepancy exists between estimations using the squares and estimations by counting assumed dots, because there are only 96 dots in the entire grid area. Cumulative values of the squares shown in the chart add up to 100 percent for the entire area within the grid. If desired, one may calculate the exact percentage values for each assumed dot and thereby make the two methods of use exactly comparable. Model B has a circular grid. The circle is 11/2 inches in diameter superimposed over quarter-inch squares. Each square has four equispaced dots (Figure 4A). This grid is made from a positive print of a photographic film mounted between thin sheets of plexiglass and fitted into the window of the box lid. Instructions for operating Model B are given on a chart mounted on the bottom of the instrument box (Figure 4B). The operator estimates overstory density by counting the dots representing overstory openings and assuming this to represent the percentage of non covered overstory area. Here again a slight discrepancy exists because there are only 96 dots included within the area of the circular grid. Exact percentage values for each dot may be calculated to estimate the entire circular area as 100 percent. This refinement is not considered necessary for ordinary use of the instrument. Instruments can be developed with different kinds, sizes, and shapes of grids and with mirrors of different curvatures. However, standardization of these properties is necessary to provide comparable information that can be duplicated. The instruments described have been thoroughly tested and have given satisfactory results with most western conifers. We believe the spherical densiometer described (either Model A or B) will serve the needs of practicing forester, range conservationist, and plant ecologist or those of most scientists doing highly technical work. Operators need a little training to become consistent in the use of the instrument. Judgment and experience is needed to differentiate between overstory areas that are considered completely covered by the overstory and those that have thin but uniformly distributed coverage. In the latter case it may be necessary to estimate the area of many small irregular openings and reduce the percentage overstory density by the sum of these. Training and experience are needed for each different forest species or type because of the differences in overstory characteristics. The season of the year is important when making measurements in forests containing deciduous species. Experience has shown that sufficient accuracy can be attained with the spherical densiometer by holding it as nearly level as possible in the hand. This is made possible by installing a circular spirit level in the mounting box. No mechanical support, such as a tripod, is needed. This adds to the practicability of the instrument in use. A large number of measurements of overstory density have been made to test the instrument. One such study involved the measurement of overstory density at points in 28 different forests. Measurements were made at each point by four different operators each using instrument Model A and Model B. The results were subjected to an analysis of variance to determine consistency of measurements. There were no significant differences among measurements made by different operators or with different instruments and none of the interactions were significant. The differences due to forests, however, were highly significant-above the 99 percent level of probability. Under similar conditions one can expect variations in overstory density measurements to be within ±1.3 percent, ±2.4 percent, and ±3.1 percent at probability levels of 70, 95, and 99 percent respectively. These variations amount to about 2, 3, and 4 percent when the standard deviation is expressed in terms of the overstory at the point of measurement (coefficient of variation). Another study involved placement of 416 different forest overstory measurements into 5 percent overstory density classes. Variation around the mean within each class was calculated and the standard deviations and coefficients of variation plotted against the overstory density classes. It was found that variation among measurements increased as the overstory being measured decreased only slightly when overstory density decreased from 100 down to about 60 percent but rapidly thereafter. When placing overstory density into 5 percent classes with the spherical densiometer, reliability in the order of about 5 percent can be expected so long as one is measuring forests that have more than about 50 percent overhead canopy. Since one naturally estimates percentage of overstory area not covered in dense forests and overstory area covered in open forests, estimations of overstory density when placed in classes will seldom vary more than ±5 percent. Loss in reliability of overstory density measurements results from placing forests in overstory density classes based on measurements with the spherical densiometer as contrasted with using the actual measurements. For instance, reliability of about ±1.3 percent can be attained when actual measurements are used whereas the reliability is reduced to about 5 percent when classes are used.},

   abstract = {Broad-scale ecological correlates affecting species richness and abundance patterns of amphibians were studied in 37 sampling sites from 15 independent protected areas in the Albertine Rift, East Africa. Amphibians were caught by a combination of sampling techniques, including time-constrained visual searching, pitfalls with drift fences, dip-netting, and opportunistic observations. In total, 73 species of amphibians were recorded, some of them occurring only once in the samples and some more than 1,000 times. Once relative field effort at each study site was taken into account, multivariate regression analyses showed that amphibian species richness was positively influenced by percent canopy cover and altitude. On the other hand, population abundance was influenced by a combination of three different variables: positively by percent canopy cover and rainfall, and negatively by human activities. The rainforest proved to play a very important role in the ecological distribution of species, with about 63% of the species being in one way or the other linked to it either as forest specialists, inhabitants of forest ecotones, or inhabitants of both forests and forest ecotones. These results have wide conservation implications. Indeed, as the mature rainforest habitat (especially at mid altitude-highland) proved to be the key habitat for the amphibian communities of the Albertine Rift, it should be a priority to recommend an accurate management and conservation of mature forests in local and regional protection programs. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

The objective of this study was to test if richness and composition of anurans species are related to available microhabitats and landscape type of sampled sites. We assume that a higher number of microhabitats increase environmental heterogeneity and this, in turn, affects species richness of amphibians. We performed the study in the Mesophytic Semideciduous Forest, a vegetation type within Atlantic Forest Domain. Between October 2010 and February 2011, we sampled 23 water bodies located in the agricultural, forest, and urban landscapes. The species richness was determined using survey at breeding sites methodology, and the availability of microhabitats was estimated visually. Thirty-four anuran species belonging to 12 families were recorded. The species richness in water bodies ranged from two to 13 species. The highest species richness was recorded in environments with a higher number of microhabitats, while the species composition in water bodies was partially grouped according to the predominant landscape type that is agricultural, forest, forest edge or urban. Our results suggest that species use specific environments (e.g. landscapes, habitat and microhabitat) for their reproductive activities.},

   abstract = {Habitat degradation alters the dynamics and composition of anuran assemblages in tropical forests. The effects of forest fragmentation on the composition of anuran assemblages are so far poorly known. We studied the joint influence of forest fragmentation and degradation on leaf-litter frogs. We specifically asked whether the processes structuring leaf-litter anuran assemblages in fragmented forests are the same as those in continuous forests. We analyzed anuran assemblages with respect to habitat characteristics, including fragmentation and degradation parameters. In comparison with continuous forests, species richness and diversity were lower and assemblage composition was altered in forest fragments. These changes seemed to be mainly caused by habitat degradation rather than forest fragmentation. Availability of aquatic sites for breeding, vegetation structure (including those variables indicating degradation), and leaf-litter cover had the most influence on the presence of single species. The comparatively small impact of fragmentation on anurans might be due to the location of the study area; it still possessed large tracts of continuous forest. These forest blocks may stabilize the regional rainforest climate and thus weaken the effects of fragmentation. © 2008 Society for Conservation Biology.},

In this paper, I discuss a variety of factors, in addition to competition, that influence the observed relationship between species distribution and the availability of suitable habitat. In particular, I show that Hutchinson's niche concept can be modified to incorporate the influences of niche width, habitat availability and dispersal, as well as interspecific competition per se. I introduce a simulation model called NICHE that embodies many of Hutchinson's original niche concepts and use this model to predict patterns of species distribution. The model may help to clarify how dispersal, niche size and competition interact, and under what conditions species might be common in unsuitable habitat or absent from suitable habitat. A brief review of the pertinent literature suggests that species are often absent from suitable habitat and present in unsuitable habitat, in ways predicted by theory. However, most tests of niche theory are hampered by inadequate consideration of what does and does not constitute suitable habitat. More conclusive evidence for these predictions will require rigorous determination of habitat suitability under field conditions. I suggest that to do this, ecologists must measure habitat specific demography and quantify how demographic parameters vary in response to temporal and spatial variation in measurable niche dimensions.},

   abstract = {A hierarchy of factors determines the microcli-mate experienced by any organism within a forest. The prevailing climate is modified first by local weather conditions (particularly cloud cover), and then by the vegetation. Crucially, the structure of the canopy controls the quantity, quality, spatial and temporal distribution of light. It also influences local precipitation and air movements. Combined, these factors determine the air humidity, temperature and to some extent the soil moisture conditions at any given point within the forest. Many silvicultural methods depend on manipulation of the forest canopy in order to create conditions favouring the survival and growth of desirable plants. These include tree seedlings, which may be the next commercial crop, and non-marketable species that have a conservation value. Light penetration also affects animal Summary The forest canopy is one of the chief determinants of the microhabitat within the forest. It affects plant growth and survival, hence determining the nature of the vegetation, and wildlife habitat. A plethora of different techniques have been devised to measure the canopy. Evaluation of the literature reveals confusion over what is actually being measured. This paper distinguishes two basic types of measurement: canopy cover is the area of the ground covered by a vertical projection of the canopy, while canopy closure is the proportion of the sky hemisphere obscured by vegetation when viewed from a single point. The principal techniques used to measure canopy cover, canopy closure, and a number of related measures are described and discussed. The advantages and limitations are outlined and some sampling guidelines are provided. The authors hope to clarify the nature of the measurements and to provide foresters with sufficient information to select techniques suitable for their needs.},

They contain valuable timber species but are threatened by farming and mining activities. The objective of this study was to describe canopy opening and light relations in two seasonally deciduous dry forests on slopes and limestone outcrops, in the Paranã valley at the northeastern region of the Goiás state, Brazil. The studied forests were in the Fazenda Sabonete in Iaciara-Go and Fazenda Forquilha in Guarani-GO. Woody plants were sampled in 25 (20 x 20 m) plots in each forest. In the Sabonete forest 40 species, 705 ind./ha-1 with a basal area of 15.78 m²/ha-1 were found, while in Forquilha there were 55 species, 956 ind./ha-1 with a basal area of 24.76 m²/ha-1. Using hemispherical photographic techniques, 25 black and white photographs were taken at each site, during the dry season, totaling 50 photographs. These were taken at the beginning of each vegetation-sampling plot. The photographs were scanned in grey tones and saved as 'Bitmap'. The canopy opening and leaf area index (LAI) were calculated using the software Winphot. The mean canopy opening was 54.0% (±9.36) for Fazenda Sabonete and 64.6% (±11.8) in Fazenda Forquilha, with both sites presenting significant differences in the opening estimates (P < 0.05). Their floristic richness and structure also differed with the more open canopy forest, Forquilha, being richer and denser, suggesting the need for further studies on species-environment relationships in these forests.

   abstract = {native plants, and the federally threatened desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) (Brooks and Esque 2002). Thus, plant invasions that alter fire regimes can have repercussions that ripple throughout ecosystems, and these multiple effects may complicate the task of restoring ecosystems to preinvasion conditions. Some of the effects of plant invasions on fire regimes have been previously described (e.g., D'Antonio and Vi-tousek 1992, Mack and D'Antonio 1998, D'Antonio 2000), but these examples largely focus on one well-known type of change, namely, grass invasions that increase fuel-bed flam-mability, and on the positive feedback cycle that can develop between invasive grasses and the frequency, size, spatial pattern, and, in some cases, intensity of fires. There are other important ways in which plant invaders can affect fuels and fire regimes, but these have not been documented as thoroughly, either because they have not yet been studied or because they are less common. In this article, we describe the full range of pathways through which plant invaders can change fuel properties and, in doing so, alter fire regimes. It is not our purpose to conduct a thorough review of this topic. Rather, we present a general conceptual model of the invasive plant-fire regime cycle that summarizes the various possible interrelationships between invasive plants, fuels, and fire regimes, including indirect links through native plants and other ecosystem properties. We also present a system designed to help managers determine what can be done at various phases of the in-vasive plant-fire regime cycle to prevent further changes and reverse the changes that have already occurred. Fire is a type of disturbance (sensu Sousa 1984), and ecosystems are partly defined on the basis of disturbance regimes of specific frequency, intensity, extent, type, and seasonality (sensu Pickett and White 1985) (figure 1). Fire frequency may be defined as a measure of the fire cycle (average time for fire to burn an area equal in size to the given area of interest) or of the fire return interval (average time before fire re-burns a given area, also called the fire recurrence interval). We use the latter definition in this article. Fire intensity, the amount of heat released per unit of time, is related to fire severity , which is the effect of this heat release on biotic and abi-otic ecosystem properties. Fire extent includes both the size and the spatial homogeneity of burning. Fires have traditionally been classified according to fire type, which includes the categories of ground fire (e.g., peat-bog fires), surface fire (e.g., grass fires), and crown fire (e.g., forest-canopy fires). Sea-sonality refers to the annual window of fire activity and is largely determined by the ability of fuels to ignite and carry fire. Disturbance regimes affect ecosystem properties such as the rates of soil erosion or formation and the pathways and temporal patterns of nutrient cycling and energy flow. Disturbance regimes can also act as a selective force affecting the life-history traits of individual species and the composition, structure, and emergent properties of entire groups of organisms. Over evolutionary time, fire regimes can promote coexistence of plant species, with different life forms dominating at different stages of postfire succession (Cowling 1987). Fire regimes are affected by spatial and temporal variations in topography, climate, and fuel (figure 1). Although topography changes over geologic time, regional climate can potentially shift within the scale of centuries to decades, and fuel conditions can change within a day following a major disturbance. Rapid fuel changes can also rapidly change micro-climates within vegetation stands. Fuels are the one ecosystem component that is inextricably linked with fire regime by feedback loops through other ecosystem properties and plants (figure 1). Shifts outside the natural range of fuel conditions can result in directional shifts in fire behavior and fire regime},

   abstract = {The Amazon and Atlantic Forest are considered the world's most biodiverse biomes. Human and climate change impacts are the principal drivers of species loss in both biomes, more severely in the Atlantic Forest. In response to species loss, the main conservation action is the creation of protected areas (PAs). Current knowledge and research on the PA network's conservation efficiency is scarce, and existing studies have mainly considered a past temporal view. In this study, we tested the efficiency of the current PA network to maintain climatically stable areas (CSAs) across the Amazon and Atlantic Forest. To this, we used an ecological niche modeling approach to biome and paleoclimatic simulations. We propose three categories of conservation priority areas for both biomes, considering CSAs, PAs and intact forest remnants. The biomes vary in their respective PA networks' protection efficiency. Regarding protect CSAs, the Amazon PA network is four times more efficient than the Atlantic Forest PA network. New conservation efforts in these two forest biomes require different approaches. We discussed the conservation actions that should be taken in each biome to increase the efficiency of the PA network, considering both the creation and expansion of PAs as well as restoration programs.},

This places a premium on priorities: how can we support the most species at the least cost? One way is to identify`biodiversityidentify`biodiversity hotspots' where exceptional concentrations of endemic species are undergoing exceptional loss of habitat. As many as 44% of all species of vascular plants and 35% of all species in four vertebrate groups are con®ned to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4% of the land surface of the Earth. This opens the way for a `silver bullet' strategy on the part of conservation planners, focusing on these hotspots in proportion to their share of the world's species at risk. The number of species threatened with extinction far outstrips available conservation resources, and the situation looks set to become rapidly worse 1±4. This places a premium on identifying priorities. How can we protect the most species per dollar invested? This key question is at the forefront of conservation planning, and forms the focus of this article. By concentrating on areas where there is greatest need and where the payoff from safeguard measures would also be greatest, conservationists can engage in a systematic response to the challenge of large-scale extinctions ahead. A promising approach is to identify`hotspotsidentify`hotspots' , or areas featuring exceptional concentrations of endemic species and experiencing exceptional loss of habitat 5±9. Here we focus on species, rather than populations or other taxa, as the most prominent and readily recognizable form of biodiversity. This is not to suggest that populations and even ecological processes are not important manifestations of biodiversity, but they do not belong in this assessment. There are other types of hotspot 10,11 , featuring richness of, for example, rare 12,13 or taxonomically unusual species 14,15. This article considers only hotspots as de®ned above. Concentrating a large proportion of conservation support on these areas would go far to stem the mass extinction of species that is now underway. The hotspots' boundaries have been determined by`biologicalby`biological commonalities'. Each of the areas features a separate biota or community of species that ®ts together as a biogeographic unit.

In this study, the feeding habits of three species of anurans (Rhinella fernandezae, Odontophrynus americanus and Physalaemus albonotatus) were compared between a soybean field and a native forest in Santa Fe Province, Argentina. Our dietary assessment is based on 124 individuals (47 R. fernandezae, 45 O. americanus and 32 P. albonotatus). Lepidopteran larvae were the predominant item in anuran diets from the soybean field, whereas collembola, isopods and snails prevailed in the diets from forests. Generally, the three anuran species shifted their diets as prey differs in the two environments, but R. fernandezae and P. albonotatus maintained a preference for a few prey types. Mean niche overlap in the soybean field was smaller than expected by chance, suggesting that the three anuran species are competing for limited resources. Trophic studies on other native anurans in agroecosystems should be a priority in conservation efforts due to their potential use as natural control agents, as well as for assessing the consequences of the broad conversion of natural forest to agricultural use in our region and throughout the world.},

   abstract = {<p>Our objectives were to develop a method that would be appropriate for long-term ecological studies, but that would permit rapid surveys to evaluate biotic complementarity and land-use planning in Amazonia. The Amazon basin covers about 7 million km². Therefore, even a sparse coverage, with one sample site per 10.000 km², would require about 700 sampling sites. Financial considerations limit the number of sites and investment at each site, but incomplete coverage makes evaluation of biotic complementarity difficult or impossible (Reddy &amp; Dávalos 2003). Our next challenge is to install similar systems throughout Amazonia. The cost, based on modification of Al Gentry's original design is moderate (less than US$ 50.000 per site if it is not necessary to immediately identify all vascular plants in plots) and we can obtain RAP results for most taxa in the short term at much lower cost. However, biological surveys will only be relevant if the local people participate and the surveys serve as much to teach the local communities about the value of their natural resources as they serve to teach the international community about biodiversity. Therefore, we want to see each site run as a long-term ecological research project by local people and institutions. Biological surveys are an important tool in land-use planning, but only the local people can implement those plans.</p>},

The highest richness and abundance indices were recorded in medium-sized fragments and in the rainy season. More marsupial species were recorded compared to rodents.

In this chapter, we introduce the Atlantic Forest focusing on describing the evolution of knowledge, the geographical limits, and the current proposals of sectorization in ecological units. The knowledge of the Atlantic Forest can be explained by three successive phases: (1) the science of naturalists (the late eighteenth century to the late nineteenth century), where the flora and fauna were described by European travelers; (2) the rise of science in Brazil, characterized by the organization of Atlantic Forest biodiversity in collections (1890–1985); and (3) the contemporary era (1985–2020), characterized by the publication of 8226 studies focused on 4 main topics – biogeography and systematics, conservation and biodiversity, plant-animal interaction, and populations and community. The understanding of the distribution limits of the Atlantic Forest biome (11 different proposals), as well as sectorization (4 different proposals), has been the subject of several studies and legislations, which are presented and discussed. Additionally, we present terminologies usually used to designate the Atlantic Forest as a whole, as well as its sectors, to facilitate understanding in future studies. We conclude that understanding the Atlantic Forest remains a long and endless exercise, given its complexity, increased knowledge, and continuous threats.},

Two MODIS vegetation indices (VI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), are produced at 1-km and 500-m resolutions and 16-day compositing periods. This paper presents an initial analysis of the MODIS NDVI and EVI performance from both radiometric and biophysical perspectives. We utilize a combination of site-intensive and regionally extensive approaches to demonstrate the performance and validity of the two indices. Our results showed a good correspondence between airborne-measured, top-of-canopy reflectances and VI values with those from the MODIS sensor at four intensively measured test sites representing semi-arid grass/shrub, savanna, and tropical forest biomes. Simultaneously derived field biophysical measures also demonstrated the scientific utility of the MODIS VI. Multitemporal profiles of the MODIS VIs over numerous biome types in North and South America well represented their seasonal phenologies. Comparisons of the MODIS-NDVI with the NOAA-14, 1-km AVHRR-NDVI temporal profiles showed that the MODIS-based index performed with higher fidelity. The dynamic range of the MODIS VIs are presented and their sensitivities in discriminating vegetation differences are evaluated in sparse and dense vegetation areas. We found the NDVI to asymptotically saturate in high biomass regions such as in the Amazon while the EVI remained sensitive to canopy variations.},

   abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change presents challenges and opportunities to the growth, reproduction, and survival of individuals throughout their life cycles. Demographic compensation among life‐history stages has the potential to buffer populations from decline, but alternatively, compounding negative effects can lead to accelerated population decline and extinction. In montane ecosystems of the <styled-content style="fixed-case">U.S.</styled-content> Pacific Northwest, increasing temperatures are resulting in a transition from snow‐dominated to rain‐dominated precipitation events, reducing snowpack. For ectotherms such as amphibians, warmer winters can reduce the frequency of critical minimum temperatures and increase the length of summer growing seasons, benefiting post‐metamorphic stages, but may also increase metabolic costs during winter months, which could decrease survival. Lower snowpack levels also result in wetlands that dry sooner or more frequently in the summer, increasing larval desiccation risk. To evaluate how these challenges and opportunities compound within a species’ life history, we collected demographic data on Cascades frog ( <italic>Rana cascadae</italic> ) in Olympic National Park in Washington state to parameterize stage‐based stochastic matrix population models under current and future (A1B, 2040s, and 2080s) environmental conditions. We estimated the proportion of reproductive effort lost each year due to drying using watershed‐specific hydrologic models, and coupled this with an analysis that relates 15 yr of <italic>R. cascadae</italic> abundance data with a suite of climate variables. We estimated the current population growth (λ <sub>s</sub> ) to be 0.97 (95% <styled-content style="fixed-case">CI</styled-content> 0.84–1.13), but predict that λ <sub>s</sub> will decline under continued climate warming, resulting in a 62% chance of extinction by the 2080s because of compounding negative effects on early and late life history stages. By the 2080s, our models predict that larval mortality will increase by 17% as a result of increased pond drying, and adult survival will decrease by 7% as winter length and summer precipitation continue to decrease. We find that reduced larval survival drives initial declines in the 2040s, but further declines in the 2080s are compounded by decreases in adult survival. Our results demonstrate the need to understand the potential for compounding or compensatory effects within different life history stages to exacerbate or buffer the effects of climate change on population growth rates through time. },

Initially covering 23 million hectares, NAF was reduced to 13%, much converted into sugarcane fields. Within NAF, in the North-eastern sugarcane zone (NESZ), land conversion happened in waves, the last in the middle 1970s, resulting in a predominant pattern of small-sized fragments in a sugarcane matrix. Acknowledged for its high endemism for plants, butterflies, and birds, high species numbers occur at a regional level and low numbers at the patch level, with a signal of taxonomic homogenization, simplification, and species loss; edge effects trigger retrogressive succession, while chronic disturbances like harvesting and hunting deplete plant and animal species. Despite all threats, some areas maintain high biodiversity and provide essential ecosystem services. Since most remnants are located within sugarcane properties, forest conservation relies on private-owned lands and their legal compliance to meet a vegetation debt that approaches 280,000 hectares and accomplish an ongoing initiative to restore approximately one million hectares. This is the key to a good prognosis for the NESZ Atlantic Forest.},

   abstract = {<p>After 500 years of exploitation and destruction, the Brazilian Atlantic Forest has been reduced to less the 8% of its original cover, and climate change may pose a new threat to the remnants of this biodiversity hotspot. In this study we used modelling techniques to determine present and future geographical distribution of 38 species of trees that are typical of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (Mata Atlântica), considering two global warming scenarios. The optimistic scenario, based in a 0.5% increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, predicts an increase of up to 2 °C in the Earth's average temperature; in the pessimistic scenario, based on a 1% increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, temperature increase may reach 4 °C. Using these parameters, the occurrence points of the studied species registered in literature, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Predictions/GARP and Maximum entropy modeling of species geographic distributions/MaxEnt we developed models of present and future possible occurrence of each species, considering Earth's mean temperature by 2050 with the optimistic and the pessimistic scenarios of CO2 emission. The results obtained show an alarming reduction in the area of possible occurrence of the species studied, as well as a shift towards southern areas of Brazil. Using GARP, on average, in the optimistic scenario this reduction is of 25% while in the pessimistic scenario it reaches 50%, and the species that will suffer the worst reduction in their possible area of occurrence are: Euterpe edulis, Mollinedia schottiana, Virola bicuhyba, Inga sessilis and Vochysia magnifica. Using MaxEnt, on average, in the optimistic scenario the reduction will be of 20% while in the pessimistic scenario it reaches 30%, and the species that will suffer the worst reduction are: Hyeronima alchorneoides, Schefflera angustissima, Andira fraxinifolia and the species of Myrtaceae studied.</p>},

The Northern Atlantic Forest (NAF) lies in the northernmost part of the biome, suffering from an old fragmentation process and with little remaining forest. In Northeastern Brazil, we also find some areas called “Brejos Nordestinos” that are enclaves of high-altitude humid forests embedded in the Caatinga semiarid region. A careful analysis of a 2019 forest cover map revealed a total of 747,926 ha of remaining forest (18.8%) distributed in 63,048 fragments (41% are smaller than 1 ha). There are only 896 forest fragments larger than 100 ha, covering an area of 437,434.6 ha. The NAF region has a few large fragments with large interior (core) forests. When considering a 90-m-edge influence, core area drops to 216,628.0 ha (30% of the area in fragments larger than 1 ha and 5.4% of the NAF area). A total of 10.5% of the NAF region is composed of Protected Areas (PA), from which 9.7% is under sustainable use and 0.8% is under strictly protection. More protected areas are needed to achieve the global goal of 17% of protected areas, and their placement should be considered in order to efficiently conserve the NAF biodiversity and its ecosystem services, creating a landscape with high connectivity. Protected Areas also must have efficient management plans, so that biodiversity protection will be effective.},

However, it is one of the less protected and studied states of the country. Here, we determined the potential distribution of all amphibian species in a risk category present in Guerrero and defined priority areas for amphibian conservation in the state. We modelled the potential distribution of 32 species using the maximum entropy modelling algorithm. These models were used to define priority areas through systematic conservation planning tools. The most important variables explaining species’ potential distribution were measures of climate variability, particularly temperature seasonality. The priority areas for amphibian conservation identified covered a total area of 12,212.72 km2 and contained an important proportion (almost a third) of the cloud mountain forests of the state. The most important planning units for meeting species targets and the most important planning units in terms of biodiversity overlapped in approximately the same planning units, located in the biogeographic regions of the Sierra Madre del Sur and the Pacific Coast. Finally, from the total priority areas identified, only 0.31% (38.17 km2) is currently protected within the existing natural protected areas in Guerrero. Thus, we consider that it is essential to protect additional natural areas in the state. Areas Voluntarily Destined for Conservation (ADVC) may be a good option; however, action must be taken to ensure the legitimacy of the processes by the local people and to avoid privileging only certain members of the community.},

Presence-only species distribution models (SDMs) represent a potential tool for assessing the biodiversity value of urban green space; however, there is limited research to validate SDM results with field surveys to see if the predictions accurately represent observed species richness. We generated a range of SDMs using multiple suitability thresholds for 23 species of amphibians that occur in southwest, Ohio, USA. The distributions were overlaid to enumerate species richness. We surveyed 20 sites for amphibian species to evaluate model predictions. Our models over-predicted species richness relative to survey data. For example, we observed a mean pairwise difference of 14 species between models of species richness and observed values. Our results suggest either SDMs built with landscape variables we selected did not represent accurately amphibian richness, or the amphibian surveys did not detect all species present. Analyzing sites that had more than three sampling events suggests the explanation of inadequate sampling effort is only partially correct. Differences such as that between predicted and observed values of species richness is a challenge for land managers and conservation biologists that need a tool for modeling biodiversity. Species distribution models did project relative species richness well in urban and non-urban green space, which suggests this technique offers a spatially explicit way to identify more species rich areas and may help managers and conservation biologists manage systems with greater efficiency.},

We ask whether microhabitat scouting is related to physiological states, specifically if microhabitat choice benefits the production of behavioral fever (e.g., increasing body temperature by selecting warmer places) or sickness behavior (e.g., inactivity and anorexia). We investigated how thermoregulatory behaviors affect hydro‐thermoregulation in anurans, using agar models as a sampling unit, simulating four behaviors related to behavioral fever and sickness behavior. We compared the models' hydro‐thermal balance in two different environments (wet and transitional forests). We showed that the wet forest was warmer and more stable than transitional forest and the agar models in the wet forest were warmer. Still, the four behavioral simulations exhibited similar average temperatures during the five‐day study period in both forests. However, the apathetic behavior models had the lowest daily temperatures. The percentage hydration across models was higher in the wet forest, and daily variation in water loss for each behavioral simulation was higher in the transitional forest. Nevertheless, when limiting the analysis to the warmest times (1000–1600 h), apathetic behavior models lost less water than the others in both forests. We showed that different forests provide microclimatic variation for understory anurans, but different thermoregulatory behaviors may lead to similar body temperatures. Therefore, the Atlantic Forest offers different microclimates and thermoregulation options for anurans, as some species could develop behavioral fever while others demonstrate sickness behavior.</p>},

We provided a dated phylogeny and biogeography study for the Sphaenorhynchini tribe using mitochondrial and nuclear genes.

This is the first large‐scale study to include an almost complete calibrated phylogeny of Sphaenorhynchini, presenting important information about the evolution and diversification of the tribe.

For some species, detailed presence/absence occurrence data are available, allowing the use of a variety of standard statistical techniques. However, absence data are not available for most species. In this paper, we introduce the use of the maximum entropy method (Maxent) for modeling species geographic distributions with presence-only data. Maxent is a general-purpose machine learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and it has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modeling. In order to investigate the efficacy of the method, here we perform a continental-scale case study using two Neotropical mammals: a lowland species of sloth, Bradypus variegatus, and a small montane murid rodent, Microryzomys minutus. We compared Maxent predictions with those of a commonly used presence-only modeling method, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). We made predictions on 10 random subsets of the occurrence records for both species, and then used the remaining localities for testing. Both algorithms provided reasonable estimates of the species’ range, far superior to the shaded outline maps available in field guides. All models were significantly better than random in both binomial tests of omission and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was almost always higher for Maxent, indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for the species. The Maxent modeling approach can be used in its present form for many applications with presence-only datasets, and merits further research and development.},

   abstract = {<p>Multimodal signals facilitate communication with conspecifics during courtship, but they can also alert eavesdropper predators. Hence, signallers face two pressures: enticing partners to mate and avoiding detection by enemies. Undefended organisms with limited escape abilities are expected to minimize predator recognition over mate attraction by limiting or modifying their signalling. Alternatively, organisms with anti-predator mechanisms such as aposematism (i.e. unprofitability signalled by warning cues) might elaborate mating signals as a consequence of reduced predation. We hypothesize that calls diversified in association with aposematism. To test this, we assembled a large acoustic signal database for a diurnal lineage of aposematic and cryptic/non-defended taxa, the poison frogs. First, we showed that aposematic and non-aposematic species share similar extinction rates, and aposematic lineages diversify more and rarely revert to the non-aposematic phenotype. We then characterized mating calls based on morphological (spectral), behavioural/physiological (temporal) and environmental traits. Of these, only spectral and temporal features were associated with aposematism. We propose that with the evolution of anti-predator defences, reduced predation facilitated the diversification of vocal signals, which then became elaborated or showy via sexual selection.</p>},

   abstract = {The Atlantic Forest is an intensely fragmented and globally important ecological hotspot. In this context, the objective of this study was to analyze the landscape ecology and submit proposals for creating ecological corridors (ECs) in a Brazilian Atlantic Forest region. Landscape ecology metrics, based on the forest fragments map, were used for the analysis. Suggested corridors were based on least-cost path analysis, considering land use, declivity, permanent preservation areas (PPAs), and forest fragment sizes. Although the predominant class sizes in the study area are small fragments, landscape ecology analysis has shown good environmental quality for fragments larger than 100 ha that do not lose their central area, even for the largest edge distances. Four ECs were proposed, with an average length of 53.86 km, average width of 5.39 km, and average area of 28,786.32 ha. Land use conflicts showed that the fragments within the corridors were situated in a matrix dominated by grassland. PPAs within the proposed corridors were dominated by misused land and did not comply with environmental legislation. The proposed corridors were efficient in using the largest fragments, which have the least edge effect and provide necessary support for most wildlife. However, we emphasize that other factors can influence the delimiting of ECs; additional studies are required to obtain more effective ECs to connect habitats. The proposed methodology can be applied to other Brazilian and global ecoregion.},

   abstract = {Among worldwide tropical forest ecosystems, the Atlantic forest of Brazil stands out as a highly fragile area and a biodiversity hotspot, with a high degree of endemism. The Caparaó National Park is an important conservation area for this biome, where recent studies have found new species of animals and plants, including endemic and highly vulnerable ones. We analyzed interannual and seasonal trends in vegetation for Caparaó National Park and its buffer zone, using data from MODIS vegetation indices between the years 2001 and 2019. Our methods included both parametric (linear trend and linear correlation) and non-parametric (Mann-Kendall) analyses of interannual trends, wavelet transform, and seasonal trends analysis. We also studied the correlation of the vegetation index data with the variability of monthly rainfall data from the TRMM satellite. We generated linear regression analyses, with precipitation as the independent variable and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) as the dependent variable, and repeated this procedure for time lags from 0 to 3 months. In accordance with the findings of the temporal profiles and Mann Kendall trend method identified a prevalence of decreasing trend in the values of vegetation indices in Caparaó National Park, with values higher than 90% of the regions where the result was significant, for the EVI and 80% for the NDVI. For the buffer zone, there is an increasing trend for the NDVI and EVI, with values higher than 50% of the regions where the result was significant. In most of the area, a positive slope was found in the buffer zone, while in the Caparaó National Park the slope was predominantly negative. The r values indicated tendencies predominantly positive for the buffer zone and predominantly negative for the area within the park. 66.9% of the results were positive trends for ndvi in the buffer zone, and 51.7% for EVI, both for r value and slope. In the park area, this trend was negative in 68.9% of the area for ndvi in both methods; 93.8% for the EVI and 93.9% for the NDVI.

These differences may be evidence of how vegetation responds to disturbances, once the vegetation in the buffer zone is fragmented and does not have the same protection as vegetation in the park area. The native vegetation in study area shows seasonal similarities, as detected by seasonal trend analysis and wavelets transform. The existence of two annual cycles is a common feature to the biome of Atlantic forest. R values for the correlation of precipitation with vegetation indices indicate high dependence of vegetation on precipitation in the study area. Values in the 0.4 to 0.8 class, represented almost 80% of the buffer zone for the NDVI and 90% for the EVI. For Caparaó National Park, this class accounted for 27% and 38% of the area for the NDVI and EVI, respectively. Vegetation in the protected area was less dependent on rainfall, which can be attributed to the fact that it can better meet its water needs through available water in the soil. In addition, due to anthropogenic pressures and a high degree of forest fragmentation, vegetation in the buffer zone may have less advanced successional stages. Our results collaborate with the range of vegetation studies in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. This methodology can be applied to larger areas around the world to provide information on vegetation trends conditions and influence of climatic variables.},

Multivariate analyses of variance using principal components representing shared acoustic and morphological parameters distinguished three groups in relation to call structure and external morphology: (1) populations belonging to a two‐note call morphotype; (2) populations with four‐note calls inhabiting the left riverbank; and (3) populations with four‐note calls inhabiting the right riverbank. Our results report a case of Amazonian anuran diversity hidden by current taxonomy and provide evidence for the upper Madeira River being a boundary between distinct populations of <italic>A. femoralis</italic> , and suggest a new taxonomic interpretation for these groups. Samples that did not fit into the general differentiation pattern and the existence of a well‐defined contact zone between two morphotypes on the left riverbank indicate that mechanisms complementary to river‐barrier hypotheses are necessary to explain the phenotypic differentiation between populations. Our study shows that at least one anuran species shows congruence between population differentiation and separation by a large Amazonian river, as documented for birds and mammals. Conservation efforts should not consider the taxon now known as <italic>A. femoralis</italic> as a homogeneous entity. There is much within‐taxon variability, which can be probably explained partly by the existence of cryptic species, partly by geological barriers and part of which currently has no obvious explanation. </p>},

   abstract = {The Atlantic Forest has a long history of human interaction and transformation, since as early as the Late Pleistocene. Throughout the centuries, native populations coevolved with their environment, at the same time that always exerted some degree of pressure on the system. The early human interactions may have contributed to the extinction of megafauna, coupled with climate becoming warmer and humid. In a second moment, more modern native populations developed slash-and-burn agriculture, leaving a distinct mark in the landscape, altering forest structure and composition. Up to this point, human interaction, although leaving a footprint, left intact a large portion of forest cover. With the implementation of the Portuguese colonial enterprise, in less than 500 years, much of the Atlantic Forest was transformed into a non-forest matrix. This dramatic spatial reorganization was mainly driven by large plantation systems, particularly sugarcane and coffee, intermixed with the introduction of large grazing mammals, converting forest into pastures using exotic African grasses. With urbanization and industrialization, energy demand leads to the transformation of large forest tracts into charcoal, up until the mid-twentieth century. The Anthropocene accelerated deforestation processes with growing urbanization and industrialization until the late twentieth century with the birth of modern conservation movements that have helped diminish deforestation rates.},

   abstract = {Ongoing anthropogenic climate change is becoming one of the major threats to biodiversity. Studies that aim at projecting the future impacts of ongoing climate change on biodiversity should use general circulation models (GCMs) that show a good performance in the region of study, an information that is lacking for the Atlantic Forest. Here, we evaluated the performance of different GCMs over the Atlantic Forest, describe the predicted climatic changes for the regions based on the best performing GCMs, review the literature on observed and predicted impacts of climate change on the Atlantic Forest biodiversity, and discuss adaptation strategies to reduce the negative impacts of climate change on the region’s biodiversity.

The Atlantic Forest, with its large latitudinal and altitudinal range, is under different climatic regimes, showing different climate change predictions in its northern and southern portions. Eight GCMs showed good performance for the following region: ACCESS1–0, CanCM4, CanESM1, CMCC-CM, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, MIROC4h, and MPI-ESM-LR. Under a business-as-usual scenario (RCP 8.5), these models project a mean temperature increase of 4.8 °C to 5.6 °C. Precipitation, however, did not show a clear trend in the Atlantic Forest as a whole, possibly because of the expected decrease in precipitation in its northern portion and increase in southern. There is a growing number of studies projecting the impacts of climate change on Atlantic Forest biodiversity, with a taxonomic bias toward terrestrial vertebrates, showing with high confidence that there is a high risk of biodiversity loss in the Atlantic Forest due to climate change. There are, however, significant knowledge gaps in altitudinal, freshwater, and coastal environments. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA), which uses ecosystems to promote societal adaptation to climate change, is particularly appropriate for the Atlantic Forest because of favorable legal background for conservation, restoration, and payment for ecosystem services in states within the biome; presence of influential civil society organizations and academic institutions; and thriving on-the-ground experiences in EbA.},

Such properties include the degree of emphasis on presence/absence vs. relative abundance information and the inclusion vs. exclusion of joint absences. Judicious use of multiple measures in concert can uncover the underlying nature of patterns in β diversity for a given dataset.

   abstract = {Patterns of species turnover are central to the geography of biodiversity and resulting challenges for conservation, but at broad scales remain relatively little understood. Here, we take a first spatially-explicitly and global perspective to link the spatial turnover of species and environments. We compare how major groups of vertebrate ectotherms (amphibians) and endotherms (birds) respond to spatial environmental gradients. We find that high levels of species turnover occur regardless of environmental turnover rates, but environmental turnover provides a lower bound for species turnover. This lower bound increases more steeply with environmental turnover in tropical realms. While bird and amphibian turnover rates are correlated, the rate of amphibian turnover is four times steeper than bird rates. This is the same factor by which average geographic ranges of birds are larger than those of amphibians. Narrow-ranged birds exhibit rapid rates of species turnover similar to those for amphibians, while wide-ranged birds largely drive the aggregate patterns of avian turnover. We confirm a strong influence of the environment on species turnover that is mediated by range sizes and regional history. In contrast to geographic patterns of species richness, we find that the turnover in one group (amphibians) is a much better predictor for the turnover in another (birds) than is environment. This result confirms the role of amphibian sensitivity to environmental conditions for patterns of turnover and supports their value as a surrogate group. This spatially-explicit analysis of environmental turnover provides understanding for conservation planning in changing environments. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

   abstract = {Beta diversity is an important concept used to describe turnover in species composition across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, and it underpins much of conservation theory and practice. Although substantial progress has been made in the mathematical and terminological treatment of different measures of beta diversity, there has been little conceptual synthesis of potential scale dependence of beta diversity with increasing spatial grain and geographic extent of sampling. Here, we evaluate different conceptual approaches to the spatial scaling of beta diversity, interpreted from 'fixed' and 'varying' perspectives of spatial grain and extent. We argue that a 'sliding window' perspective, in which spatial grain and extent covary, is an informative way to conceptualize community differentiation across scales. This concept more realistically reflects the varying empirical approaches that researchers adopt in field sampling and the varying scales of landscape perception by different organisms. Scale dependence in beta diversity has broad implications for emerging fields in ecology and biogeography, such as the integration of fine-resolution ecogenomic data with large-scale macroecological studies, as well as for guiding appropriate management responses to threats to biodiversity operating at different spatial scales. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

In northeastern Brazil, sparse rainforest remnants located in highlands north of the São Francisco River are surrounded by the dry and open landscape of the Caatinga biome. Earlier studies suggested that these forests were historical refuges to the rainforest fauna and flora during Pleistocene's climatic cycles. However, it is still unclear whether populations in distinct highlands experienced phenotypic differentiation as a result of adaptation to environmental conditions of each forest remnant. Herein, we used two frog species widely distributed and ecologically different, Dendropsophus oliveirai, a habitat specialist, and Physalaemus cuvieri, a habitat generalist, to investigate the relationships between environmental variation, geographic, genetic, and body size distance with advertisement call variation among populations inhabiting different highlands. Our results indicated that acoustic variation among P. cuvieri populations is strongly influenced by environmental variation, but also by the geographic distance among populations. In D. oliveirai, environment is also the most influent factor on acoustic variation, followed by a lower influence of genetic and morphological variation. Associations between environmental and geographic factors suggest indirect effects of geographic distance on acoustic variation in both species through an environmental gradient. We believe that selective processes and isolation by distance possibly act together in driving interpopulational acoustic variation with habitat-specific species being more affected by geographic isolation in suitable habitats.

Shifts in amphibian ranges are predicted. Changes in climate may affect survival, growth, reproduction and dispersal capabilities. Moreover, climate change can alter amphibian habitats including vegetation, soil, and hydrology. Climate change can influence food availability, predator-prey relationships and competitive interactions which can alter community structure. Climate change can also alter pathogen-host dynamics and greatly influence how diseases are manifested. Changes in climate can interact with other stressors such as UV-B radiation and contaminants. The interactions among all these factors are complex and are probably driving some amphibian population declines and extinctions.</p>},

The resources used by these two groups in the leaf litter are likely to differ, as well as their sampled species richness, abundance and biomass as resource availability changes. We conducted a 12-month survey of leaf litter anuran assemblages at three forest areas in the largest Atlantic Forest remnant in the state of Minas Gerais in southeastern Brazil. Each month we estimated, based on capture rates, anuran species richness, abundance, and biomass as assemblage descriptors. We also measured variables that could potentially affect these descriptors in space and time: invertebrate litter fauna (abundance and richness of taxa), leaf litter biomass, and microclimatic conditions (air humidity, air and soil temperature, soil water content, and rainfall). We tested for differences in these variables among areas. We used general linear models to search for the variables that best explained variation in anuran abundance (based on capture rates) throughout the year. We analyzed species with terrestrial development (TD) and with aquatic larvae (AL) separately. We recorded 326 anurans of 15 species. Sampled anuran abundance (correlated to species richness and biomass) was explained by air humidity and/or invertebrate abundance for species with TD, and by soil water content or air humidity and leaf litter biomass for species with AL. The variability in the results of studies on leaf litter frogs that try to find variables to explain changes in community descriptors may be due to spatial variation of resources among areas and also to the fact that TD and AL species are frequently analyzed together, when in fact they are likely to show different responses to resources present in the leaf litter habitat, reflected on capture rates.},

Leaf litter constitutes a primary resource in freshwater systems, and variation in litter quality can alter the growth and development of aquatic consumers. It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that variation in litter quality might also induce phenotypic changes in consumers. To test this hypothesis, we exposed two densities of wood frog ( <italic>Lithobates sylvaticus</italic> [ <italic>Rana sylvatica</italic> ]) tadpoles to six chemically distinct species of leaf litter from temperate broadleaf and coniferous trees. After several weeks, we quantified development rate, growth rate, intestinal length, size of the oral disc, and five external dimensions of the tadpoles. In addition to substantial changes in growth and development rates, we found striking changes in all morphological responses among different leaf litter environments, including up to 14% longer intestines, 11% deeper tails, and 6% deeper tail muscles. In addition, we found strong relationships of total nitrogen content with all morphological features except growth rate. Our results indicate that differences in resource quality can induce phenotypic changes that are as large as or larger than changes induced by resource quantity. Our study also has substantial implications for the future of aquatic consumers living in forested wetlands given that these forests are currently experiencing widespread changes in tree composition. </p>},

We surveyed frogs in six distinct habitats: slash and burn agriculture, seasonally flooded forest (bajo), aquatic habitats (lagoons and small ponds), second growth upland forest, primary forest and creek habitat using both systematic and non-systematic surveys. The highest species richness of frogs was documented in primary forest and small ponds. In contrast, no frogs were recorded in second growth forest. Similarly, tank bromeliads (Aechmea bracteata) were completely absent from early successional stages and were almost twice as abundant in seasonally flooded forest as in upland forest. The vertical distribution of A. bracteata differed between forest types, and they significantly more abundant in larger diameter trees. We examined 60 tank bromeliads during the peak of the dry season to test their use as refugia by frogs. Approximately 27% of tank bromeliads sampled had arboreal frogs belonging to three species, but 9 species have been recorded as occasional users of bromeliads in the region. There were significantly more frogs on large than on medium-sized bromeliads, and frogs were more abundant on bromeliads higher on host trees, particularly those above 3 m in height. Our results suggest that the loss of tank bromeliads from drier and less structurally complex habitats created by slash and burn agriculture and selective logging results in loss of refugia for arboreal frogs in this seasonal tropical forest.

Four amphibian species were found to be negatively associated with the presence of predatory fish. Species richness of ponds without fish and ponds without predatory fish did not differ significantly, whereas ponds containing only predatory fish had significantly lower amphibian richness. A significant positive relationship was found between the emergent vegetation cover and pond occupancy of six amphibian species and amphibian species richness. As a management recommendation, we suggest the restriction of fish introductions to non predatory fish and the maintenance of high emergent vegetation cover in the ponds.},

Amphibians in the aquatic environment (aquatic life stages or postmetamorphic aquatic amphibians) and terrestrial living juvenile or adult amphibians are assumed to be covered by the risk assessment for aquatic invertebrates and fish, or mammals and birds, respectively. This procedure has been evaluated as being sufficiently protective regarding the acute risk posed by a number of pesticides to aquatic amphibian life stages (eggs, larvae). However, it is unknown whether the exposure and sensitivity of terrestrial living amphibians are comparable to mammalian and avian exposure and sensitivity. We reviewed the literature on dermal pesticide absorption and toxicity studies for terrestrial life stages of amphibians, focusing on the dermal exposure pathway, that is, through treated soil or direct overspray. In vitro studies demonstrated that cutaneous absorption of chemicals is significant and that chemical percutaneous passage, P (cm/h), is higher in amphibians than in mammals. In vivo, the rapid and substantial uptake of the herbicide atrazine from treated soil by toads ( <italic>Bufo americanus</italic> ) has been described. Severe toxic effects on various amphibian species have been reported for field‐relevant application rates of different pesticides. In general, exposure and toxicity studies for terrestrial amphibian life stages are scarce, and the reported data indicate the need for further research, especially in light of the global amphibian decline.

Specimens with striped dorsa were less common (13–18%) than those with non-striped dorsa (81–86%), the latter group comprising a mix of discrete color pattern states, whose frequencies were not different among juveniles, males, and females. The PCAs on morphometric data resulted in a strong degree of superposition between striped and non-striped dorsa, for both genders. We encountered a diploid number of 30 chromosomes for both males and females, with chromosome pairs 1 to 15 being telocentric. The karyotypic comparison between specimens with striped and non-striped dorsa did not show any noticeable difference. Nevertheless the karyotype of I. ramagii from Salvador, Bahia, differed from the karyotype described for I. paulodutrai from Ilhéus, Bahia, which showed a submetacentric chromosome pair. This result supports the presence of two full “sibling” species in Bahia State, one from the south (I. paulodutrai) and another from the north (I. ramagii), validating the identity of I. paulodutrai as a full species, and refuting the recognition of Salvador samples as I. paulodutrai.

   abstract = {Information on animal communities inhabiting Neotropical fragmented landscapes is important for developing conservation strategies. The structure of amphibian and reptile communities in six tropical rainforest fragments (<20 ha) and two reference areas in continuous forest at Los Tuxtlas, Mexico was studied. A total of 3,481 individuals of 51 species of amphibians and reptiles were recorded across 12 bimonthly surveys during 2 years. Taxonomic composition was different between the smallest fragments and the reference areas. Six species were exclusive to large undisturbed forest and richness was significantly lower in the five smallest fragments (1.4-6.6 ha) compared with the largest patch, one or both of the reference areas. Amphibian abundance tended to be higher in large areas, while reptiles were more abundant in the five smallest fragments. Craugastor loki and Anolis uniformis were the dominant species in all sites, and particularly in the smaller fragments. Amphibian and reptile richness was positively related to larger patch sizes, deeper leaf litter, closed canopy cover, and higher relative humidity and negatively related to linear patch shape and high temperatures. Abundance of reptiles was positively associated to high temperatures, high density of woody debris, and closed canopy cover; it was negatively affected by linear patch shape, low humidity levels, and steeper slopes. While amphibian and reptile communities were strongly affected in vegetation fragments, these patches retained a considerable number of rainforest species. Fragments up to at least 17 ha have the potential for preserving communities with similar structure to those occurring in large tropical rainforests. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

We sampled ten sites between May 1998 and November 2000: five TMCF fragments and five anthropogenic habitats. For the entire landscape, we registered 21 species belonging to six families. 100% of these were found in the TMCF fragments and 62% in the surrounding mosaic of anthropogenic habitats. Gamma diversity (γ) is determined to a greater extent by species exchange (β) than by local species richness (α). Elevational variation, the degree of conservation of the vegetation canopy and fragment size appear to determine the species diversity of this landscape. Large species, terrestrial species, those whose eggs develop outside water, and those whose larvae develop in the water seemed to be most affected by habitat transformation. On its own, even the largest and most species-rich cloud forest fragment is not capable of preserving the current anuran diversity. Neither are the shaded coffee plantations that are interspersed among and link the patches of TMCF. However together they form a diverse system of habitats crucial to species conservation in this landscape. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We used gap analysis to evaluate whether or not the protected area network of northeastern Brazil safeguards populations of threatened amphibians that occur in this region. Data on species geographical ranges were obtained from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and were overlapped on the northeastern Brazilian protected area network using ArcGIS 9.3. The threatened amphibians found in northeastern Brazil were represented by remnant populations of Adelophryne baturitensis, Adelophryne maranguapensis, Allobates olfersioides, and Agalychnis granulosa. There are 174 protected areas in the protected area network in northeastern Brazil. The network is made up of 65 strict protection areas (IUCN categories I-II) and 109 sustainable use areas (IUCN categories III-VI). The network corresponds to more than 15 million ha, which equates to about 10% of the region's total area. However, the size of the protected areas along the geographical range of these species doesn't necessarily guarantee their persistence in the future. The main threat to these species is loss of habitat due to deforestation and agricultural expansion. Therefore, the viability of new reserves with a diversity of representative ecosystems in northeastern Brazil may be the best solution to avoid extinction processes in this region. © 2013 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.},

   abstract = {As a group amphibians are the vertebrates most affected by anthropic activity, particularly by agriculture. The rapid advance of the agricultural frontier makes it important to identify the role of agroecosystems as habitat supply for amphibians. We analyzed the differences in amphibian assemblages and populations between habitats with different plant covers and different degrees of human intervention in northwestern Argentina. For three years we conducted 114 high frequency trap samplings to quantify abundance, specific composition and species richness of amphibian assemblages in three habitat types (lemon and sugarcane crops and secondary forest) of a piedmont agroecosystem of Tucumán province. Crops hosted more species and individuals than secondary forests, but the specific composition of forest was different from that of crops suggesting that they could be complementary. Although the assemblage abundance of every observation responded to climate, the strong effect of sampling year was not related to climatic factors suggesting that there might be long term fluctuations that were not analyzed. We also found that responses to agricultural practices were species specific, so no generalizations about these practices should be done. Our study shows that cultivated areas are not hostile environments for amphibians since they can lodge huge amphibian populations and that the occurrence of disturbances associated to agricultural practices is not necessarily reflected in a decrease in the abundance and richness of amphibians in the short term. However, our results also show that forested lands are necessary to lodge some specialist species which are very rare in the croplands. This suggests that environmental heterogeneity generated by the combination of natural and cultivated patches can increase biodiversity at landscape scale because this allows the coexistence of species related to either kind of environment.},

   abstract = {Forest fragmentation often causes biodiversity loss, but there is no consistent pattern on species' reactions. Considering the alarming rate of deforestation in the tropics, and the fact, that large areas of protected continuous forest are limited, it becomes increasingly important to determine the biodiversity value of fragmented forests. In order to investigate fragmentation effects on rainforest frogs in Madagascar and to assess the conservation value of these fragments, we analyzed amphibian diversity in a continuous rainforest and nearby forest fragments. We hypothesized that species richness is lower in fragments compared to continuous forest, and that fragmentation leads to altered assemblage composition. We found no fragmentation effects on species richness, demonstrating that fragments may maintain local species richness comparable to continuous forest. The presence of streams was the most important factor for high species richness, independent of fragmentation status. However, we detected fragmentation effects on species composition. As expected, several species were restricted to continuous forest, but many species occurred in both forest types, and some species were only found in fragments. Rainforest amphibians in our study area were less sensitive to fragmentation than expected. Adaptations to natural disturbances like cyclones could be one reason to explain this. However, as some species exclusively occurred in continuous forest and species composition differed between continuous forest and fragments, we conclude that fragments cannot substitute continuous forest blocs, but are generally important for maintaining amphibian diversity in Madagascar, especially if they comprise streams. Forest fragments should hence be included in conservation planning.},

   abstract = {Amphibians are facing extinctions worldwide as a result of numerous factors. Habitat alteration has long been implicated in the loss of biodiversity; however, we still do not know how different animal assemblages respond to habitat alteration. To investigate the impacts of anthropogenic habitat alteration on diversity, we studied amphibian assemblages across different habitats in the Chocó rainforest of northwest Ecuador. Amphibian diversity was estimated using intensive surveys along transects in primary and altered (historically logged) forest and riparian habitats, as well as along roads with varying levels of ongoing human activity. Our results suggest an interaction between habitat type and alteration on the diversity and composition of amphibian assemblages. Amphibian assemblages along rivers were the richest as well as the least impacted by habitat alteration. In addition, riparian zones harbored amphibian assemblages distinct from other habitat types, including rare and endangered species. Diversity and species richness were lower in secondary than in primary forest, suggesting that amphibian assemblages in interior forest habitat may be more vulnerable to alterations caused by logging. These findings suggest that amphibian assemblages in different habitat types (i.e., riparian vs. interior forest) may vary in vulnerability to habitat alteration. We discuss these findings in relation to land management plans that promote amphibian diversity in northwest Ecuador and recognize a good potential indicator species, Oophaga sylvatica, for identifying pristine habitat.},

Data show this fungus to be widely distributed. Infected specimens included Colostethus olfersioides (Dendrobatidae), Bokermannohyla gouveai and Hypsiboas freicanecae (Hylidae), as well as Thoropa miliaris and Crossodactylus caramaschii (Leptodactylidae), extending the area of B. dendrobatidis occurrence in Brazil approximately 1,600 km N, 200 km S, and 270 km E.

An infection record dating to 1981 roughly coincides with the time of the first observations of amphibian declines in the country. Widespread occurrence of B. dendrobatidis in the Atlantic Forest adds to the challenge of conserving an already endangered biome given the potential risk of further local biodiversity loss. Further research is needed to understand how environmental and genetic factors relate to chytridiomycosis in leading to or preventing local die-offs.

It not only affects the diversity of local species communities (alpha diversity) but can also lead to large-scale homogenization of community composition (reduced beta diversity) and loss of regional diversity (gamma diversity), but these effects are still rarely investigated. We assessed the impact of land-use change on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of amphibians in Rwanda, both on the local (community-level) and regional scale (country-wide). Alpha diversity in local communities was higher in farmland than in natural habitats; however, species turnover among farmland sites was much lower than among natural sites, resulting in highly homogenized communities and reduced taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic gamma diversity in farmland across Rwanda. Amphibians found in farmland were mostly disturbance-tolerant species that are widespread in eastern Africa and beyond. In contrast, most of the regionally endemic frog species that make this region a continent-wide hotspot of amphibian diversity were found only in the natural habitats. Ongoing habitat conversion might result in further homogenization of amphibian communities across sub-Saharan Africa and the loss of regional endemism, unique evolutionary lineages, and multifunctionality.},

   abstract = {Seasonality exerts strong pressures on biodiversity patterns. Yet, temporal beta-diversity is poorly studied in tropical systems, and the drivers of variability in amphibian activity and seasonality remain largely unknown. We quantified intra- and interannual variation in temporal beta-diversity relying on a nine-year, year-round survey (51 species, n > 23,000) performed in a protected area (Betampona, Madagascar). We assessed the dependence on climate of beta-diversity and abundance using a distance-based redundancy analysis and generalised linear mixed models, respectively. Despite the majority of species being preferentially active during one specific period, beta-diversity and abundance were more variable between years than within years. Temporal variation in beta-diversity was best explained by temperature (but climate accounted for only 2% of variation). Species abundance was best explained by temperature (for 32% of the tested species), monthly humidity (30%) and monthly rainfall (24%). We found no climatic dependence for 24% of the species. Our results suggest that studies focusing on species phenology can be misleading when based on single-year surveys even in seasonal systems. The high interannual variability in diversity may be due to an adaptive responses to an important regime of stochastic events. Given the direction of the relationships between weather and abundances, we predict that a large proportion of amphibians would suffer from climate change in Madagascar. We emphasise the need to account for multiple temporal scales in studies of tropical species composition and abundance to better understand species phenology and their response to climate change, and make targeted conservation actions more effective.},

   abstract = {Ecologists have long realized that stable species richness values can mask rapid turnover in species composition. Because turnover occurs as a consequence of both local and regional processes, understanding the responsible factors provides insight on processes influencing community structure at different scales. Despite the insights to be gained from data on species turnover, they remain relatively uncommon. We present data on the interannual turnover in species composition of larval amphibian communities in 37 ponds over seven years. Species composition of a given pond community was highly dynamic; about half of the species that could be found breeding in a particular pond were actually present in a given year. All species participated in this community turnover, but to different degrees. Using a model selection approach, we show that a statistical model including local environmental factors (pond area, hydroperiod, and canopy cover) and pond connectivity on the landscape provided the best predictions of turnover. Averaged parameter estimates were significant for area, hydroperiod, and connectivity and these same variables were identified by hierarchical partitioning as having significant independent effects on turnover. Area and hydroperiod were negatively related to turnover, whereas connectivity was positively related to turnover. Additionally, the average fraction of years a species was present in a pond was positively correlated with average local population size, but even more strongly correlated with regional population size, suggesting both local and regional influences on turnover. Of the measured biotic factors (biomass of fish, invertebrate predators, anuran and caudate larvae), presence of fish was the only factor that significantly affected rates of turnover. Several mechanism could be responsible for changes in species composition (species extinctions, skipped breeding and movement of choruses), but extinctions appear to be the major cause of turnover. These results have important implications to understanding long-term persistence of species on landscapes and the causes of patterns in species richness on environmental gradients.},

Theory suggests that community composition is influenced by environmental gradients or biotic processes. This study examines patterns of community composition in two tropical tree frog assemblages of primary and exploited lowland rain-forest sites in the Guiana Shield area of central Guyana, South America and the Upper Guinean rain-forest block of south-western Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa. We tested community composition and species abundance data of two adult tree frog communities collected on 21 standardized transects during a period of 5 y for evidence of spatial correlation in community composition. We applied simple and partial Mantel tests to separate the effects of environmental variables, spatial distance and spatial autocorrelation on community composition. Whenever environmental effects were accounted for, we found significant positive spatial correlation of community composition. All assemblages appeared to be spatially structured, i.e. sites in close proximity had similar species assemblages. However, spatially structured environmental variation (autocorrelation) did not account for the spatial structure of species incidence. Environmental factors did not prove to be significant predictors of species incidence in any of the assemblages analysed, even if we controlled for spatial effects. Observed correlation patterns of species composition were consistent within respective realms and disturbance regimes. Moreover, general correlation patterns were consistent between geographic regions. These results are in contrast to previously published results from a study on leaf-litter anurans and indicate that group-specific differences must not be neglected when analysing patterns of species composition in anurans as they may drastically alter the outcome of the analysis. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.},

The study recorded 14 species belonging to six families with higher species diversity, whereby the Shannon Wiener (H’) value in the adjacent forest (H’ = 1.71) was higher as compared to the restoration area (H’ = 0.77). The anuran species in the restoration area showed an adaptation to bare soil, herbs, and shrubs. Meanwhile, in the forest, forest litter was favoured by the anuran species. Species abundance demonstrated correlation towards microclimate. The adaption of two species to the restoration area showed that temperature had a significant and negative correlation with Duttaphrynus melanostictus; relative humidity was significant and positively correlated with Polypedates leucomystax; while relative humidity had a significant and negative correlation with Microhyla annectens, a forest specialist.

However, few studies explore the relationships of diversity metrics across contrasting ecosystems. We evaluated the effect of ecosystems (tropical dry forest and pine-oak forest) and seasons (wet and dry) on the functional diversity and community composition of amphibians in western Mexico. Our study showed that associations among metrics of diversity were not constant across contrasting ecosystems. The amphibian communities were related to changes in the environmental variables of elevation, temperature and relative humidity. We analyzed the functional diversity of the amphibian community based on 11 traits related to reproduction, trophic flow and habitat use. Seven functional groups with distinct ecological characteristics were detected, of which, four presented functional redundancy and two were represented by a single species. While the tropical dry forest during the wet season showed the highest species richness, the richness and diversity of functional groups were significantly lower than in the pine-oak forest in both seasons. These results suggest that the seasonal drought in the tropical dry forest could act as an environmental filter, promoting dominance of similar functional traits among species, while limiting similarity could be acting in the pine-oak forest, in the face of relatively stable hydric conditions, allowing a greater functional diversity. Analysis of the relationship between biological communities and ecosystem functioning is necessary to undertake conservation strategies.},

So, the relative contributions of environmental and spatial predictors in the patterns of taxonomic and functional anuran beta diversity were examined in a metacommunity of 33 ponds along the coast of south Brazil. We expected that neutral processes and, in particular, niche-based processes could have similar influence on the taxonomic and functional beta diversity patterns. Distance-based methods (db-RDA) with variation partitioning were conducted with abundance data to examine taxonomic and functional facets and components (total, turnover and nestedness) in relation to environmental and spatial predictors. Processes determining metacommunity structure differed between the components of beta diversity and among taxonomic and functional diversity. While taxonomic beta diversity was further accounted by both environmental and spatial predictors, functional beta diversity responded more strongly to spatial predictors. These two contrasting patterns were different to what we had predicted, suggesting that while there is a taxonomic turnover mediated by environmental filters, the spatial distance promotes the trait dissimilarity between sites. In addition, our data confirm that neutral and niche-based processes operate on anuran metacommunities even at short geographic scales. Our results reinforce the idea that studies aiming to evaluate the patterns of structure in metacommunities should include different facets of diversity so that better interpretations can be achieved.},

   abstract = {Aim: The links between taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity and how these vary geographically are key to understanding how historical and contemporary processes have shaped communities at regional and local scales. Here, we evaluate the links between taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity for the amphibians in the Continental Americas and how these vary geographically under an explicit hypothesis testing framework. Location: Continental Americas. Taxon: Amphibia. Methods: We identify spatial disparities between biodiversity dimensions (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic) using geographically weighted regressions. Based on these mismatches we examined whether different eco-evolutionary processes would fit (competitive exclusion, habitat filtering, available ecological space, strong biotic interactions, speciation rates, and dispersion). Results: We found extensive variation in spatial mismatches between the three dimensions of biodiversity examined here. In general, at higher latitudes, we detected relatively little phylogenetic diversity, suggesting rapid functional diversification from temperate clades. In contrast, at low latitudes, environmental filtering mechanisms appear to be restricting functional diversity. Main conclusions: The geographical mismatches between dimensions of diversity suggest different eco-evolutionary causes. Patterns of diversification across amphibian lineages demonstrate how different environments can have contrasting effects on the different dimensions of diversity, potentially leading to decoupling. Neither dimension of alpha diversity of amphibians is a general predictor for another, and thus, general explanations for amphibian diversity and evolution should be avoided. Nonetheless, these dimensions can provide critical insights about conservation measures that explicitly emphasize evolutionary history, functionality or classic species richness.},

   abstract = {A new instrument called a "spherical densiometer" has been described for estimating forest overstory density. 2 This pocket-type instrument employs a mirror with spherical curvature which makes possible the reflection of a large overhead area. A grid is used to estimate percentage of this overhead area covered with forest canopy. Estimation is usually from a point near the forest floor. Adequate sampling gives the average canopy of a forest area. Two models, A and B (Figures 1 and 2), have been adopted as standard. Each employs a highly polished chrome mirror 21/2 inches in diameter and having the curvature of a 6 inch sphere. The convex side of the mirror is used in Model A and the concave side in Model B. Each has some advantages over the other. The mirrors are mounted in small wooden recessed boxes with hinged lids similar to compass boxes. The overall dimensions are about 31/2 x 31/2 x 11/8 inches. A circular spirit level is mounted (recessed) beside the mirrors. Positive slide fasteners are provided in Model B which allow the lid to open to an angle of about 45 degrees. Cross-shaped and circular grids with squares and dots are used to estimate overstory coverage by tree crowns. Grids are of two kinds: (1) those scratched upon the surface of the mirror (Model A), and (2) those superimposed between the mirror and the eye (Model B). The cross-shaped grid scratched upon the convex surface of the mirror in Model A has 24 quarter-inch squares (Figure 3A). Instructions for using the densiometer and cumulative values for the squares on the grid are shown on a chart that is attached to the inside of the box lid (Figure 3B). It is easier and faster to estimate the relative amount of overstory coverage with this instrument by assuming the presence of four equi-spaced dots in each square and by counting dots representing openings in the canopy. The percentage of overstory density is then assumed to be the complement of this number. Each assumed dot is assigned a value of one percent in this case. A slight discrepancy exists between estimations using the squares and estimations by counting assumed dots, because there are only 96 dots in the entire grid area. Cumulative values of the squares shown in the chart add up to 100 percent for the entire area within the grid. If desired, one may calculate the exact percentage values for each assumed dot and thereby make the two methods of use exactly comparable. Model B has a circular grid. The circle is 11/2 inches in diameter superimposed over quarter-inch squares. Each square has four equispaced dots (Figure 4A). This grid is made from a positive print of a photographic film mounted between thin sheets of plexiglass and fitted into the window of the box lid. Instructions for operating Model B are given on a chart mounted on the bottom of the instrument box (Figure 4B). The operator estimates overstory density by counting the dots representing overstory openings and assuming this to represent the percentage of non covered overstory area. Here again a slight discrepancy exists because there are only 96 dots included within the area of the circular grid. Exact percentage values for each dot may be calculated to estimate the entire circular area as 100 percent. This refinement is not considered necessary for ordinary use of the instrument. Instruments can be developed with different kinds, sizes, and shapes of grids and with mirrors of different curvatures. However, standardization of these properties is necessary to provide comparable information that can be duplicated. The instruments described have been thoroughly tested and have given satisfactory results with most western conifers. We believe the spherical densiometer described (either Model A or B) will serve the needs of practicing forester, range conservationist, and plant ecologist or those of most scientists doing highly technical work. Operators need a little training to become consistent in the use of the instrument. Judgment and experience is needed to differentiate between overstory areas that are considered completely covered by the overstory and those that have thin but uniformly distributed coverage. In the latter case it may be necessary to estimate the area of many small irregular openings and reduce the percentage overstory density by the sum of these. Training and experience are needed for each different forest species or type because of the differences in overstory characteristics. The season of the year is important when making measurements in forests containing deciduous species. Experience has shown that sufficient accuracy can be attained with the spherical densiometer by holding it as nearly level as possible in the hand. This is made possible by installing a circular spirit level in the mounting box. No mechanical support, such as a tripod, is needed. This adds to the practicability of the instrument in use. A large number of measurements of overstory density have been made to test the instrument. One such study involved the measurement of overstory density at points in 28 different forests. Measurements were made at each point by four different operators each using instrument Model A and Model B. The results were subjected to an analysis of variance to determine consistency of measurements. There were no significant differences among measurements made by different operators or with different instruments and none of the interactions were significant. The differences due to forests, however, were highly significant-above the 99 percent level of probability. Under similar conditions one can expect variations in overstory density measurements to be within ±1.3 percent, ±2.4 percent, and ±3.1 percent at probability levels of 70, 95, and 99 percent respectively. These variations amount to about 2, 3, and 4 percent when the standard deviation is expressed in terms of the overstory at the point of measurement (coefficient of variation). Another study involved placement of 416 different forest overstory measurements into 5 percent overstory density classes. Variation around the mean within each class was calculated and the standard deviations and coefficients of variation plotted against the overstory density classes. It was found that variation among measurements increased as the overstory being measured decreased only slightly when overstory density decreased from 100 down to about 60 percent but rapidly thereafter. When placing overstory density into 5 percent classes with the spherical densiometer, reliability in the order of about 5 percent can be expected so long as one is measuring forests that have more than about 50 percent overhead canopy. Since one naturally estimates percentage of overstory area not covered in dense forests and overstory area covered in open forests, estimations of overstory density when placed in classes will seldom vary more than ±5 percent. Loss in reliability of overstory density measurements results from placing forests in overstory density classes based on measurements with the spherical densiometer as contrasted with using the actual measurements. For instance, reliability of about ±1.3 percent can be attained when actual measurements are used whereas the reliability is reduced to about 5 percent when classes are used.},

   abstract = {Tropical forest restoration is increasingly seen as an activity that may counteract or reduce biodiversity loss. However, few studies monitor fauna or consider measures of functional diversity to assess restoration success. We assessed the effect of a tropical montane forest restoration program on species and functional diversity, using amphibians as the target group. We compared amphibian assemblages in three types of land use: restoration areas, tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF; reference ecosystem) and cattle pastures (degraded ecosystem) in southern Mexico. We also described microclimate, microhabitat heterogeneity, woody vegetation structure and diversity for each type of land use, and their relationship to amphibian species and functional diversity. Compared to TMCF, restoration areas had similar environmental conditions. However, amphibian species richness was similar in the three types of land use and abundance was lower in the restoration areas. In TMCF, the amphibian assemblage was dominated by forest-specialist species, the pastures by generalist species, and the restoration areas by a combination of both species types. Interestingly, functional richness, functional evenness and functional divergence did not vary with land use, though the number of functional groups in restoration areas and TMCF was slightly higher. Overall, the results suggest that after seven years, active restoration provided habitat heterogeneity and recovered woody vegetation capable of maintaining amphibian species and functional groups similar to those inhabiting TMCF. Forest fragments adjacent to restoration areas seem to facilitate fauna recolonization and this emphasizes the importance of the conservation of the reference ecosystems to achieving restoration success.},

   abstract = {In community ecology, contrasting theories suggest that the distribution and abundance of species, and thus the composition of assemblages, are influenced by i) environmental gradients, or ii) contagious biotic processes such as predation, competition, dispersal and disease. In the former case, sites with similar environments would tend to support similar assemblages, while in the latter, geographically proximate sites would tend to support more similar assemblages than widely separated sites. I investigated the relative influence of environmental variables and spatial position on the composition of frog assemblages at forest streams in sub-tropical eastern Australia using redundancy analysis (RDA) and partial RDA. Data on the maximum abundance of the frog species at 65 survey sites were transformed such that RDA would yield the Hellinger distance between sites. The following analysis identified 11 environmental variables that explained 45% of the variation in the abundance of species at the survey sites (the species matrix), as a proportion of total variance. The geographic co-ordinates of the survey sites accounted for 12%, while the environmental and spatial variables combined accounted for 47% of the variation in the species matrix. Partial redundancy analysis indicated that of the explained variation, 74% was purely environmental, 5% was purely spatial and 21% was spatial environmental variation. This study is the first to quantify the relative influence of environmental and spatial variables on the composition of amphibian assemblages. It provides support for both the environmental control model and the biotic control model of species' distributions and assemblage composition, although environmental variables appear to have the greater effect at this scale of analysis.},

Poikilothermic organisms, such as amphibians, are particularly prone to alterations in temperature and precipitation and are therefore expected to be severely impacted by global climate change. We evaluated: i) the potential effects of climate change on taxonomic and functional richness of amphibians in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, and ii) tested whether forest-dependent and open area species responded differently to climatic stressors. We applied an ensemble forecasting approach using point locality data to establish predictive maps of taxonomic and functional richness for different IPCC AR5 scenarios with two Representative Concentration Pathway trajectories (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) at two temporal projections (2050 and 2070). A significant decline in both taxonomic and functional richness of Atlantic Forest amphibians is expected over the coming decades under the evaluated climate scenarios. The core areas projected to maintain significantly high anuran richness in both components were in coastal high-altitude localities. We found negative effects (losses) to be more pronounced for taxonomic richness. Model outcomes indicate significant losses in both forest and open area species. A few remaining high-altitude sites will then play an important role as potential climatic refuges to safeguard anuran diversity, requiring a dynamic landscape approach as conservation strategy.},

Here, using multiple datasets on fish abundance in 541 streams we tested 1) if communities composed of small populations are more spatially variable and 2) less related to the environment variation than communities composed of large populations. We used process-based simulations to identify β-diversity metrics and community–environment measures that were appropriate to investigate the role of assembly processes along a gradient of community size. We show that variation in species composition among small communities is higher than among large communities and that the strength of community–environment relationships is weaker in small communities. Our results indicate that community size affects the strength of ecological drift and environmental selection in metacommunities. We thus suggest that further declines in the size of populations and ecosystems can make spatial variation in biodiversity more unpredictable.},

The habitat alteration types which include primary forest, selectively logged primary forest, secondary forest, abandoned farm areas and pasture (this represents a gradient of habitat alteration ranging from least altered to most altered, respectively) also encompass two habitat types: stream and terrestrial. Species assemblage was compared between habitat alteration types and habitat types, where a total 360 leaf-litter and semi-aquatic amphibians were observed (15 species, 6 families). It was found that amphibian abundance was significantly higher in both forest and stream habitat, and species richness did not differ with respect to habitat alteration type. It was determined, however, that species richness was highly dependent on habitat type (significantly higher in stream habitat). Meanwhile, diversity (Shannon–Wiener) was significantly higher in both forest and stream habitat, and species composition differed markedly between habitat alteration types for stream strip plots. Forest habitat exhibited domination by forest specialist species, while altered habitat (abandoned farm areas and pasture) exhibited domination by open-habitat specialist species. Additionally, strong relationships were found between species composition and abundance, as well as richness and diversity (within the measured habitat structures and observed microclimatic conditions). Analyses determined that the higher abundance of leaf-litter and semi-aquatic amphibians was best explained by higher DBH (1.3 m from the ground) and lower temperature and the higher species richness was best explained by higher understorey density. Additionally, higher diversity was associated with increasing understorey density, tree density and temperature. In general, the assemblage of leaf-litter and semi-aquatic amphibians in the lowland tropical rainforest in northeastern Leyte was affected by habitat alteration, highlighting the on-going importance of conservation efforts.},

Additionally, the realization of the multidimensionality of biodiversity demands studies integrating variation of functional traits and phylogenetic information as complements to address the effects of land use on the structure of animal communities. Herein, we investigated the effects of land use (i.e., intensive agricultural and extensive livestock rearing) on functional and phylogenetic diversity of anuran communities in farmland ponds from the Uruguayan savanna ecoregion, while considering the effects of local factors (i.e., water depth) on species composition. We surveyed adults and tadpoles in 22 ponds and quantified five traits related to tadpole feeding, habitat use, and predator avoidance. Tadpole identification was corroborated by DNA barcoding based on a fragment of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene. We observed a decline in phylogenetic mean nearest taxon distance associated with increase of surrounding agricultural land use. While land use intensification did not affect richness (functional or phylogenetic), ponds in livestock ranches hosted about four times more tadpoles than agricultural ponds. Functional evenness decreased with water depth, although such relationship disappeared when considering phylogenetic non-independence. Our results indicated that specific anuran clades were more sensitive to intensification in land use, reinforcing a recent view of phylogenetic homogenization following habitat conversion. Additionally, our study suggests that extensive cattle grazing over wide native pastures may provide an alternative more compatible with conservation than short-term crops in subtropical grasslands.

   abstract = {Although human-modified habitats often result in a loss of biodiversity, some have been found to serve as habitat refuges for threatened species. Given the globally declining status of amphibians, understanding why some species are found in heavily modified environments is of considerable interest. We used the endangered green and golden bell frog (. Litoria aurea) as a model to investigate the factors influencing their distribution toward industrial areas within a landscape. The number of permanent waterbodies within a kilometer of surveyed sites was the best predictor of L. aurea occupancy, abundance and reproduction. It appears that industrial activities, such as dredging and waste disposal inadvertently created refuge habitat for L. aurea to fortuitously persist in a heavily modified landscape. Future conservation plans should mimic the positive effects of industrialization, such as increasing the number of permanent waterbodies, especially in areas containing ephemeral or isolated waterbodies and threatened with drought. Our findings also suggest that despite amphibians being relatively small animals, some species may require a larger landscape than anticipated. Recognizing life history traits, in combination with a landscape-based approach toward species with perceived limited motility, may result in more successful conservation outcomes. Identifying why threatened species persist in heavily disturbed landscapes, such as industrial sites, can provide direction toward future conservation efforts to prevent and reverse their decline.},

   abstract = {Anthropogenic habitat alteration has long been neglected as a factor in the analysis of predictability patterns in biological communities. We tested this factor by investigating anuran leaf litter assemblages in primary and secondary forests of Taï National Park, Ivory Coast, during two years. We measured predictability of assemblage composition by analyzing correlations between the off-diagonal elements of distance matrices based on (1) species distribution, (2) environmental characteristics, and (3) geographic distance. Pairwise correlations between matrices were significant in all cases when considering data pooled across time and habitats. A different pattern emerged when data were split according to season and disturbance level (i.e., primary vs. secondary habitats). Assemblage composition in primary habitats was correlated with geographic proximity of sites exclusively, indicating otherwise stochastic recruitment from a regional species pool at the local community level. In contrast, assemblage composition in secondary habitats was predictable based on environmental parameters, not geographical proximity. This can be inferred to be the result of a strong local site filter effect (i.e., physiologically more-restrictive conditions within secondary forest habitats, especially due to an altered microclimate). Results were consistent throughout seasons. The observed transition in predictability patterns indicates that anthropogenic , disturbance not only affects system descriptors, such as species richness, abundance, and diversity, but may also alter the system's dynamics. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Previous studies suggested that the distribution of larval anurans at the landscape-scale is influenced by environmental gradients related to adult breeding site selection, such as pond canopy cover, but not by water chemistry. However, the combined effects of spatial, pond morphology, and water chemistry variables on metacommunity structure of larval anurans have not been analyzed yet. We used a partial redundancy analysis with variation partitioning to analyze the relative influence of pond morphology (e.g., depth, area, and aquatic vegetation), water chemistry, and spatial variables on a tadpole metacommunity from southeastern Brazil. We predict that pond morphology and canopy cover will influence the metacommunity at broad spatial scales, while water chemistry would play a larger role at finer scales. We found that broad-scale spatial patterns of pond canopy cover and pond morphology strongly influenced metacommunity structure, with water chemistry being not significant. Additionally, species composition was spatially autocorrelated at short distances. We suggest that the reproductive behavior of adult anurans is driving tadpole metacommunity dynamics, since pond morphology, but not water chemistry affects breeding site selection by adults.

   abstract = {Anurans are a highly diverse group in the Atlantic Forest hotspot (AF), yet distribution patterns and species richness gradients are not randomly distributed throughout the biome. Thus, we explore how anuran species are distributed in this complex and biodiverse hotspot, and hypothesize that this group can be distinguished by different cohesive regions. We used range maps of 497 species to obtain a presence/absence data grid, resolved to 50650 km grain size, which was submitted to k-means clustering with v-fold cross-validation to determine the biogeographic regions. We also explored the extent to which current environmental variables, topography, and floristic structure of the AF are expected to identify the cluster patterns recognized by the k-means clustering. The biogeographic patterns found for amphibians are broadly congruent with ecoregions identified in the AF, but their edges, and sometimes the whole extent of some clusters, present much less resolved pattern compared to previous classification. We also identified that climate, topography, and vegetation structure of the AF explained a high percentage of variance of the cluster patterns identified, but the magnitude of the regression coefficients shifted regarding their importance in explaining the variance for each cluster. Specifically, we propose that the anuran fauna of the AF can be split into four biogeographic regions: a) less diverse and widely-ranged species that predominantly occur in the inland semideciduous forests; b) northern small-ranged species that presumably evolved within the Pleistocene forest refugia; c) highly diverse and small-ranged species from the southeastern Brazilian mountain chain and its adjacent semideciduous forest; and d) southern species from the Araucaria forest. Finally, the high congruence among the cluster patterns and previous eco-regions identified for the AF suggests that preserving the underlying habitat structure helps to preserve the historical and ecological signals that underlie the geographic distribution of AF anurans. © 2014 Vasconcelos et al.},

   abstract = {Biogeographical history and current ecological interactions have usually been addressed separately to explain the spatial distribution of patterns of biodiversity. In this study, we evaluated the integrated effects of biogeographical and environmental factors in structuring the diurnal amphibian anuran assemblages of the upper Madeira River, southwestern Amazonia. We used a sampling design involving 98 standardized units, distributed across seven locations covering both banks of the river's course in the state of Rondônia, Brazil. We conducted searches for frogs in three campaigns between February 2010 and February 2011, aiming to: (1) evaluate the effect of the Madeira River as a biogeographic barrier at the species-assemblage level, and (2) test the influence of seven environmental variables (vegetation structure, vegetation cover, soil nutrients, soil structure, slope, elevation, and distance from the river bank) on the spatial structure of the frog assemblages, separately on each riverbank. Thirteen species of diurnal frogs were recorded, six of which were restricted to one of the river margins. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated a significant effect of the river as a barrier. Multiple regression analyses suggested that the environmental variables structuring frog assemblages differ on either side of the river. We found that both historical elements (on a regional scale) and environmental factors (at a local scale) shaped the occurrence and distribution of frog species in the study area.},

   abstract = {Aim To identify priority areas for amphibian conservation in southeastern Brazil, by integrating species life-history traits and patterns of deforestation. Location State of São Paulo, Brazil. Methods We used the software Marxan to evaluate different scenarios of amphibian conservation planning. Our approach differs from previous methods by explicitly including two different landscape metrics; habitat split for species with aquatic larvae, and habitat loss for species with terrestrial development. We evaluated the effect of habitat requirements by classifying species breeding habitats in five categories (flowing water, still water permanent, still water temporary, bromeliad or bamboo, and terrestrial). We performed analyses using two scales, grid cells and watersheds and also considered nature preserves as protected areas. Results We found contrasting patterns of deforestation between coastal and inland regions. Seventy-six grid cells and 14 watersheds are capable of representing each species at least once. When accounting for grid cells already protected in state and national parks and considering species habitat requirements we found 16 high-priority grid cells for species with one or two reproductive habitats, and only one cell representing species with four habitat requirements. Key areas for the conservation of species breeding in flowing and permanent still waters are concentrated in southern state, while those for amphibians breeding in temporary ponds are concentrated in central to eastern zones. Eastern highland zones are key areas for preserving species breeding terrestrially by direct or indirect development. Species breeding in bromeliads and bamboos are already well represented in protected areas. Main conclusions Our results emphasize the need to integrate information on landscape configuration and species life-history traits to produce more ecologically relevant conservation strategies. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Aim: Lack of biological information is a silent but strong impediment for planning how to rescue amphibians from extinction. Currently, 24% of all amphibian species are assigned to the Data Deficient (DD) category of IUCN. Here, we aim to identify priority areas for amphibian research that could help gather information on these species and overcome such knowledge gap. Location: Global. Taxon: Amphibians. Methods: We mapped the distribution of 1578 DD amphibian species and then defined priority research areas as those areas with high and complementary concentration of amphibian DD species that could be considered important areas for studying (and therefore conserving) such species. To evaluate the performance of the proposed priority research areas, we calculated the percentage of species overlapping these areas, considering all amphibian DD species; recently described species and geographically restricted DD species. We also determined the proportion of priority research areas falling inside each continent and country of the world. Finally, we estimated the level protection of these species and of human pressure on natural ecosystems found within our priority research areas. Results: We showed that gathering biological information of species from just 0.4% of the world area could clarify the conservation status of more than 80% of DD amphibians. Most identified priority research areas overlap with regions under high human pressure and only a small percentage of DD amphibian species might cope with those altered conditions. Main conclusions: Knowledge shortfalls represent a major issue for amphibian conservation globally, however, the picture could radically change if research efforts and investments are geographically strategically distributed. This study brings the first application of a complementary-based tool, which has been originally designed and implemented in conservation planning, aimed at generating information that help researchers to fill knowledge gaps as efficiently as possible.},

In floodplains-such as the South American Pantanal wetlands-cyclic changes within terrestrial and aquatic biotopes can limit the distribution and occurrence of species. To test the influence of the habitat on the anuran community structure in the Pantanal, we recorded data on species composition and abundance at 30 sampling plots, from October 2006 to May 2007. We also recorded data on seven local environmental variables: water depth, distance to the nearest permanent water body, hydroperiod, leaf litter volume, plant cover by herbaceous plants, by monospecific stands of a bromeliad, and by shrubby/arboreal woody plants. We used multivariate statistical analyses to test for data correlation. In addition, we analyzed the degrees of associations of anuran species to habitat types. Our results revealed no influence of any of the analyzed environmental variables on the anuran species richness and abundance. However, species composition varied with vegetation structural complexity and the hydroperiod. Although most anurans were able to occupy different habitats along the environmental gradient, six species were strongly associated with specific habitats. The homogenizing effect imposed by floods on different habitat types might overshadow distributional patterns resulting from species-specific attributes, as well as from influences of other environmental factors.},

We aim to assess the importance of biotic predictors in the output of distribution models of the Brazilian squirrel (Sciurus aestu-ans) throughout South America based on fruits of Syagrus romanzoffiana – the most consumed food resource. We hypothesized that the distribution model of S. aestuans using its main food resource as a biotic predictor will be more accurate in comparison with the output of the model without the biotic predictor. We built three different distribution models: (i) distribution of S. romanzoffiana; (ii) distribution of S. aestuans without biotic predictor; and (iii) distribution of S. aestuans with biotic predictor. We evaluated performance scores, number of presence pixels and concordance between suitability maps. We found that performance scores may not vary between models with different predictors, but the output map changed significantly. We also found that models with biotic predictors seem to vary less in presence pixels. Furthermore, the main variable in the distribution model was the biotic vari-able. We conclude that the knowledge of a species’ biology and ecology can make better predictions of species distribution models mainly by avoiding commission errors.},

We sampled two Amazonian anuran species, Phyzelaphryne miriamae and Phyzelaphryne sp., in 11 permanent sampling modules distributed across ~600 km in the Purus-Madeira Interfluve between 2013 and 2014. Using mixed generalized linear models, we found that the species have distinct environmental associations, which may facilitate their coexistence in sympatry. Phyzelaphryne miriamae was more frequent in environments with low precipitation and low water tables, suggesting this species is better adapted to live in drier places. In contrast, Phyzelaphryne sp. appeared to be a generalist regarding to habitat and resource use. These patterns are in accordance with the hypothesis that environmental variables influence sister species differently on a fine scale. Phyzelaphryne miriamae is larger than Phyzelaphryne sp., which may make it more resistant to dehydration, allowing it to explore drier environments. In conclusion, our results are in concordance with the hypothesis that the evolution of characteristics resulting from selection may have reduced competition for resources between closely related species, thus facilitating coexistence in sympatry.

   abstract = {Introduction: The ability to relocate home or breeding sites after experimental removal has been observed in several amphibians and the sensory basis of this behavior has been studied in some temperate-region species. However, the actual return trajectories have rarely been quantified in these studies and it remains unknown how different cues guide the homing behavior. Dendrobatidae (dart-poison frogs) exhibit some of the most complex spatial behaviors among amphibians, such as territoriality and tadpole transport. Recent data showed that Allobates femoralis, a frog with paternal tadpole transport, successfully returns to the home territories after experimental translocations of up to 400 m. In the present study, we used harmonic direction finding to obtain homing trajectories. Additionally, we quantified the initial orientation of individuals, translocated 10 m to 105 m, in an arena assay.Results: Tracking experiments revealed that homing trajectories are characterized by long periods of immobility (up to several days) and short periods (several hours) of rapid movement, closely fitting a straight line towards the home territory. In the arena assay, the frogs showed significant homeward orientation for translocation distances of 35 m to 70 m but not for longer and shorter distances.Conclusions: Our results describe a very accurate homing behavior in male A. femoralis. The straightness of trajectories and initial homeward orientation suggest integration of learned landmarks providing a map position for translocated individuals. Future research should focus on the role of learning in homing behavior and the exact nature of cues being used. © 2014 Pašukonis et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Predictions of future species' ranges under climate change are needed for conservation planning, for which species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used. However, global climate model-based (GCM) output grids can bias the area identified as suitable when these are used as SDM predictor variables, because GCM outputs, typically at least 50 X 50 km, are biologically coarse. We tested the assumption that species ranges can be equally well portrayed in SDMs operating on base data of different grid sizes by comparing SDM performance statistics and area selected by four SDMs run at seven grid sizes, for nine species of contrasting range size. Area selected was disproportionately larger for SDMs run on larger grid sizes, indicating a cut-off point above which model results were less reliable. Up to 2.89 times more species range area was selected by SDMs operating on grids above 50 X 50 km, compared to SDMs operating at 1 km2. Spatial congruence between areas selected as range also diverged as grid size increased, particularly for species with ranges between 20 000 and 90 000 km2. These results indicate the need for caution when using such data to plan future protected areas, because an overly large predicted range could lead to inappropriate reserve location selection. © 2008 The Royal Society.},

In addition, we report on the daily pattern of calling activity and the use of space by marked individuals. Rainfall was a strong determinant of the calling and breeding activities at a seasonal scale. The phenology of A. femoralis was affected by interannual differences in both the length and severity of the dry season. This species showed a consistent diel pattern throughout the year, with calling activity peaking between 1500 and 1600 h. At the seasonal scale, calling activity was higher during the wet months and was correlated positively with monthly rainfall. Although recruitment is concentrated in the late wet season, our observations of juveniles in the smallest size classes throughout the year indicated that reproduction occurs sporadically even during the dry season, probably stimulated by isolated episodes of rainfall. Territories varied greatly in size, ranging from 4.8 to 175.7 m2. Females did not establish or defend territories. Individuals of both sexes showed regional interseasonal attachment, and males maintained territories for up to 255 days. © 2012 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.},

The profiles thus obtained are obviously related to niche concepts in the Grinnell tradition, and separated from those in Elton's tradition. I argue that it is useful to define Grinnellian and Eltonian niches on the basis of the types of variables used to calculate them, the natural spatial scale at which they can be measured, and the dispersal of the individuals over the environment. I use set theory notation and analogies derived from population ecology theory to obtain formal definitions of areas of distribution and several types of niches.

   abstract = {In this work we evaluated anuran species distribution in an Atlantic forest fragmented landscape, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Sampling was carried out in three continuous forest sites, 12 forest fragments, and five pasture areas (matrix). We recorded, by visual encounter surveys, 2,495 individuals from 50 amphibian species for all sampled areas. Considering the pooled data, higher richness occurs in continuous forest area. Additionally, more than a third of species that occurred in continuous forest area did not occur in fragments or in matrix. Both ordination analyses showed that continuous forest sites clustered together and matrix areas seemed to be separated from other areas. This ordination resulted from the existence of species occurring only in continuous forest, suggesting that these species may be sensitive to habitat fragmentation. Besides, matrix appears separated from other areas due to occurrence of frog species typical from disturbed environments, which are not recorded in continuous forest sites or in sampled fragments. By analyzing the effect of landscape metrics, we found that there was a tendency for fragments with lower isolation to have higher species richness and proportion of species which did not occur in matrix areas and amphibian local communities seems to be affected in a more local scale by habitat changes. Because local matrix is apparently hostile to typically forest-associated amphibian species, many of them may be unable to reach most isolated fragments by dispersal, which may explain observed results. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

However, there exists no broad-scale information about the spatial distribution of its remnants that could guide conservation actions, especially when systematic biodiversity data are not available. In this context, our objectives were to quantify how much of the forest still remains, and analyze its spatial distribution. We considered the entire Brazilian Atlantic Forest, and eight sub-regions, defined according to species distribution. The results revealed a serious situation: more than 80% of the fragments are <50 ha, almost half the remaining forest is <100 m from its edges, the average distance between fragments is large (1440 m), and nature reserves protect only 9% of the remaining forest and 1% of the original forest. On the other hand, our estimates of existing Atlantic Forest cover were higher than previous ones (7-8%), ranging from 11.4% to 16%. The differences among estimates are mainly related to our inclusion of intermediate secondary forests and small fragments (<100 ha), which correspond to approximately 32-40% of what remains. We suggest some guidelines for conservation: (i) large mature forest fragments should be a conservation priority; (ii) smaller fragments can be managed in order to maintain functionally linked mosaics; (iii) the matrix surrounding fragments should be managed so as to minimize edge effects and improve connectivity; and (iv) restoration actions should be taken, particularly in certain key areas. The clear differences in the amount remaining and its spatial distribution within each sub-region must be considered when planning for biodiversity conservation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We studied size-based habitat selection of artificial phytotelmata for deposition of tadpoles in two species of poison-dart frogs, Dendrobates auratus and Oophaga granulifera, in Costa Rica. Dendrobates auratus exhibits male parental care, and its tadpoles are predaceous, whereas O. granulifera exhibits biparental care, and its tadpoles are obligatory trophic egg eaters. These behavioral traits are integral factors in habitat selection for these two species. We found that the predaceous D. auratus selected large- and medium-sized pools, whereas O. granulifera selected all pool sizes but had a preference for small pools. Oophaga granulifera paid a high cost for exploiting large pools experiencing 100% mortality when sharing a pool with D. auratus. The use of small versus large pools in these species is rooted in each species' divergent parental care strategies and tadpole feeding behaviors.

The present study explored the effect of the structural complexity of terrestrial bromeliads as a refuge site, as well as the influence of macro-spatial variables on the abundance of anurans in the Caatinga biome. This study was carried out in the municipality of Paulo Afonso, state of Bahia, northeast of Brazil, where two sites with a high abundance of bromeliads of the species Aechmea aquilega were selected. The sites were visited twice a month, in a total of 15 visits. The survey of the presence and abundance of anurans in the interior of the plants was performed visually. Bromeliads with anurans inside had their height, leaf number and internal temperature (intrinsic variables) measured. Air temperature, air humidity and precipitation (extrinsic variables) were also measured. Principal Component Analysis and Multiple Regression Model were used to identify the influence of these variables on the abundance of anurans in the interior of the plants. A total of 147 anurans, distributed among the Bufonidae and Hylidae families, were found, with an average of 1.3 individuals per bromeliad and 9.8 individuals per visit. The internal temperature of the bromeliads was 1.6oC lower than air temperature, however, the intrinsic and extrinsic variables did not have an effect on the abundance of anurans. Anurans preferably used large bromeliads, with 78.2% of individuals using bromeliads taller than 60 cm. The results suggested that the biotic and abiotic factors discussed did not significantly influence the use of bromeliads by anurans. Additional studies addressing other aspects of the structural complexity of bromeliads and environmental factors are necessary to better understand the use of these plants by anurans in the Caatinga biome. © 2013 by Unisinos.},

We recorded 446 adults, 267 tadpoles, and 40 juveniles over the two years. Most bromeliads contained one adult frog with a mean number of 2-3 tadpoles. The structure of bromeliads influenced species abundance more than local climate. We found that bromeliad size, volume of central tank, and presence/absence of invertebrates and of water influenced frog abundance. Abundance increased in larger bromeliads at higher elevation. Changes in the structure and size of bromeliads might, therefore, affect abundance. We provide the first species assessment and evaluation of threat categories for this poorly known species.},

Herein, acoustic and ecological data were used to investigate the relationships among 12 anurans that co-occur in temporary ponds in the Caatinga, Cabaceiras municipality, Paraíba state, Brazil. Anurans exhibited calling activity correlated with rainfall, but were also spatially dispersed. High overlap levels in calling microhabitats and acoustic parameters were observed, especially among pairs of closely related species. Analysis of null models showed a lack of structure in the spatial and acoustic niche, indicating the lack of detected competition. Results suggest that the calling activity of the species is strongly influenced by rainfall, moreover, the temporal partition appears to ensure coexistence. Finally, strong historical effects were detected in Leiuperinae, Leptodactylidae and in the partition Hylidae–Leptodactyliformes.},

Restoring the existing legal debt could increase native vegetation cover in the Atlantic Forest up to 35%. Such effort, if well planned and implemented, could reduce extinction processes by increasing connectivity of vegetation remnants and rising total native cover to above the critical biodiversity threshold established for different taxonomic groups.

In this study we investigated whether rates of dehydration and rehydration are able to explain the spatial distribution of an anuran community in a Restinga environment at the northern coast of the State of Bahia, Brazil, represented by 11 species distributed in 27 sample units. The environmental data set containing 20 variables was reduced to a few synthetic axes by principal component analysis (PCA). Physiological variables measured were rates of dehydration, rehydration from water, and rehydration from a neutral substrate. Multiple regression analyses were used to test the null hypothesis of no association between the environmental data set (synthetic axes of PCA) and each axis representative of a physiological variable, which was rejected (P < 0.001). Of 15 possible partial regressions only rehydration rate from neutral substrate vs. PC1 and PC2, rehydration rate from water vs. PC1, and dehydration rate vs. PC2 were significant. Our analysis was influenced by a gradient between two different groups of sample units: a beach area with high density of bromeliads and an environment without bodies of water with low density of bromeliads. Species of very specific natural history and morphological characters occur in these environments: Phyllodytes melanomystax and Scinax auratus, species frequently occurring in terrestrial bromeliads, and Ischnocnema paulodutrai, common along the northern coast of Bahia and usually found in forest remnants within environments with low number of bodies of water. In dry environments species with lower rates of dehydration were dominant, whereas species showing greater rates of dehydration were found predominantly in microhabitats with greater moisture or abundance of bodies of water. © 2012 by The Herpetologists' League, Inc.},

We used EI, a metric that calculates cumulative effects across all nearby edges, in combination with five environmental variables that are part of the amphibians' microhabitat (temperature, humidity, slope, canopy cover and leaf litter depth) to understand how their biodiversity patterns are impacted. Our results show that most amphibian species tend to be habitat specialists, and many had an affinity for forest edges and warmer habitats. We do not find significant correlations between EI and amphibian life-history traits and diversity. Our findings corroborate previous results that many amphibian species tend to be positively associated with habitat fragmentation and show that this association is likely driven by thermal regulation.},

This is of particular concern for reptiles and amphibians because they form a significant component of the world's vertebrate fauna, play a pivotal role in ecosystem functioning and are often neglected in biodiversity research. A framework to predict how exotic plant invasion will affect reptile and amphibian assemblages is imperative for conservation, management and the identification of research priorities. Here, we present a new predictive framework that integrates three mechanistic models. These models are based on exotic plant invasion altering: (1) habitat structure; (2) herbivory and predator-prey interactions; (3) the reproductive success of reptile and amphibian species and assemblages. We present a series of testable predictions from these models that arise from the interplay over time among three exotic plant traits (growth form, area of coverage, taxonomic distinctiveness) and six traits of reptiles and amphibians (body size, lifespan, home range size, habitat specialisation, diet, reproductive strategy). A literature review provided robust empirical evidence of exotic plant impacts on reptiles and amphibians from each of the three model mechanisms. Evidence relating to the role of body size and diet was less clear-cut, indicating the need for further research. The literature provided limited empirical support for many of the other model predictions. This was not, however, because findings contradicted our model predictions but because research in this area is sparse. In particular, the small number of studies specifically examining the effects of exotic plants on amphibians highlights the pressing need for quantitative research in this area. There is enormous scope for detailed empirical investigation of interactions between exotic plants and reptile and amphibian species and assemblages. The framework presented here and further testing of predictions will provide a basis for informing and prioritising environmental management and exotic plant control efforts. © 2010 The Authors.

The study was carried out in Vale Natural Reserve, state of Espírito Santo, Brazil, from June 2015 to October 2016. We sampled the anuran community in 21 plots of 250 m in length, with 10 m of width. We recorded a total of 326 individuals of anurans, corresponding to 23 species in six families. We concluded that the anurans community of the Vale Natural Reserve remained relatively stable throughout the seasons and along vegetation types in terms of richness but differed in composition and abundance. The anurans were more abundant in the rainy season, with precipitation being the most important factor for anuran density in the area. Anuran community composition varied among vegetation types due to differences in complexity and structure of each vegetation type. Our study showed that different factors were determinant for the variation in species abundance and composition in the area. Therefore, the conservation of fragments and their associated habitat and the monitoring of environmental changes is of fundamental importance in anuran conservation in the area.},

   abstract = {Zeros (i.e. events that do not happen) are the source of two common phenomena in count data: overdispersion and zero-inflation. Zeros have multiple origins in a dataset: false zeros occur due to errors in the experimental design or the observer; structural zeros are related to the ecological or evolutionary restrictions of the system under study; and random zeros are the result of the sampling variability. Identifying the type of zeros and their relation with overdispersion and/or zero inflation is key to select the most appropriate statistical model. Here we review the different modelling options in relation to the presence of overdispersion and zero inflation, tested through the dispersion and zero inflation indices. We then examine the theory of the zero-inflated (ZI) models and the use of the score tests to assess overdispersion and zero inflation over a model. In order to choose an adequate model when analysing count data we suggest the following protocol: Step 1) classify the zeros and minimize the presence of false zeros; Step 2) identify suitable covariates; Step 3) test the data for overdispersion and zero-inflation and Step 4) choose the most adequate model based on the results of step 3 and use score tests to determine whether more complex models should be implemented. We applied the recommended protocol on a real dataset on plant–herbivore interactions to evaluate the suitability of six different models (Poisson, NB and their zero-inflated versions—ZIP, ZINB). Our data were overdispersed and zero-inflated, and the ZINB was the model with the best fit, as predicted. Ignoring overdispersion and/or zero inflation during data analyses caused biased estimates of the statistical parameters and serious errors in the interpretation of the results. Our results are a clear example on how the conclusions of an ecological hypothesis can change depending on the model applied. Understanding how zeros arise in count data, for example identifying the potential sources of structural zeros, is essential to select the best statistical design. A good model not only fits the data correctly but also takes into account the idiosyncrasies of the biological system.},

We sampled these ecosystems over a 2-yr period and compared five sites in relation to their habitat structure, frog species composition, species abundance, and their distribution in different mesohabitats. We found that the composition of the amphibian communities was not related systematically to habitat structure in general, but rather to the availability of spawning sites (sources of freestanding water), which appears to be the most important ecological factor structuring these communities.},

We integrated >126,000 verified citizen science observations of frogs, with a global continuous measure of anthropogenic habitat modification for a continental scale analysis of the effects of habitat modification on frogs. We derived a modification tolerance index—accounting for anthropogenic stressors such as human habitation, agriculture, transport and energy production—for 87 species (36% of all Australian frog species). We used this index to quantify and rank each species' tolerance of anthropogenic habitat modification, then compiled traits of all the frog species and assessed how well these equipped species to tolerate modified habitats. Most of Australia's frog species examined were adversely affected by habitat modification. Habitat specialists and species with large geographic range sizes were the least tolerant of habitat modification. Call dominant frequency, body size, clutch type and calling position (i.e. from vegetation) were also related to tolerance of habitat modification. There is an urgent need for improved consideration of anthropogenic impacts and improved conservation measures to ensure the long-term persistence of frog populations, particularly focused on specialists and species identified as intolerant of modified habitats.},

This analysis suggests that other factors not analysed herein may also be important for predicting anuran species richness and the number of reproductive modes in Brazil. Altitude and total annual rainfall were positively correlated with anuran species richness and the number of reproductive modes, and total annual rainfall was strongly associated with these two biotic variables in the triplot of pRDA.

We alternated the sampling grain and extent of the study area (among ponds at a site, among ponds within regions, among sites within regions, and among sites within regions pooled together) to assess the importance of anuran beta diversity components. We then performed variation partitioning to evaluate the congruence of environmental descriptors and geographical distance in explaining the spatial distribution of the species replacement and nestedness components. We found that species replacement was the main component of beta diversity, independent of the sampling grain and extent. Furthermore, when considering the same sampling grain and increasing the extent, the values of species replacement increased. On the other hand, when considering the same extent and increasing the sampling grain, the values of species replacement decreased. At the smallest sampling grain and extent, the environmental descriptors and geographic distance were not congruent and alternated in the percentage of variation explaining the spatial distribution of species replacement and nestedness. At the largest spatial scales (SSs), the biogeographical regions showed higher values of the percentage explaining the variation in the beta diversity components. We found high values of species replacement independently of the spatial resolution, but the processes driving community assembly seem to be dependent on the SS. At small scales, both stochastic and deterministic factors might be important processes structuring anuran tadpole assemblages. On the other hand, at a large spatial grain and extent, the processes restricting species distributions might be more effective for drawing inferences regarding the variation in anuran beta diversity in different regions of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.},

One of the global hotspots of amphibian declines is Brazil's Atlantic Forest (AF), an ecoregion that in the past covered over 1,300,000 km2 of luxuriant coastal rainforests. Reports of historical declines were concentrated in the southern and southeastern sections of AF, however we now propose that these reports did not capture the whole extent and complexity of historical amphibian declines. Here, we conducted a refined review of historical amphibian declines that have been linked to environmental factors, climatic anomalies, and the emergence of the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). We reviewed data on 169 populations of 106 species that have undergone population declines in the southern and southeastern Atlantic Forest, more than doubling the number of population declines reported in previous studies. These numbers place the Atlantic Forest among the ecoregions with the highest rates of amphibian declines and extinctions globally. We provide novel spatiotemporal information of amphibian declines, underscoring that the peak of declines happened in 1979, and that population recoveries, when they occurred, often took over 30 years. Our analyses indicate that the volume of field collections accessioned in museums over time matched temporal patterns of declines and extinctions, which indicates that historical declines might have impacted a far larger number of amphibian populations and species. Our review helps guide targeted management programs for amphibian surveys and Bd surveillance with practical implications for conservation.},

We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of 34 years of AF landscape change between 1986 and 2020. We analyzed landscape metrics of forest vegetation only (FV), forest plus other natural vegetation (NV), and the sensitivity of metrics to linear infrastructure. Currently, the AF remnants comprise 22.9% of FV and 36.3% of NV, an extent that has decreased by 2.4% and 3.6% since 1986, respectively. Linear infrastructure affected mainly the largest fragments (>500,000 ha), reducing their size by 56%–94%. The period before 2005 was characterized by loss of FV and NV (3% and 3.43%) and decrease in the number of FV and NV fragments (8.6% and 8.1%). In contrast, after 2005 the vegetation stabilized, with a recovery of 1 Mha of FV (0.6%) and an increase in the number of fragments, due in part to environmental policies. However, the AF is still a highly fragmented domain: 97% of the vegetation fragments are small (<50 ha), with an average fragment size between 16.3 and 25.5 ha; 50–60% of the vegetation is <90 m from its edges, and the isolation between fragments is high (250–830 m).

   abstract = {Here we present a three-year survey of amphibian and reptile species registered in the Vale Natural Reserve (VNR), located in the north of Espírito Santo, southeastern Brazil. The VNR, along with the Sooretama Biological Reserve (SBR) and other surrounding areas, form a forest block that constitutes one of the largest remnants of continuous forest in the Atlantic Forest biome. We systematically sampled the herpetofauna community from 2015 to 2018, using the method of active search method in 27 plots of RAPELD distributed in the different types of vegetation present in the area. We recorded 39 species of amphibians belonging to the order Anura, distributed in seven families and 40 species of reptiles belonging to 20 families distributed in three orders: Crocodylia, Testudines and Squamata. The supplementation the samplings with those records from occasional encounters was important for the survey of the region’s herpetofauna, mainly for reptiles. We added four species (two lizards, one amphisbaenid and one snake) to the known list for the VNR-SBR forest block: Micrablepharus maximiliani, Strobilurus torquatus, Amphisbaena alba and Tantilla sp. We demonstrated that VNR contains a high species richness of amphibians and reptiles, with a high number of anurans being endemic to the Atlantic Forest biome. The present species inventory provided the most current approximation of known the richness and composition of species of the existing herpetofauna at Vale Natural Reserve, since the period of the gathering of records is quite recent (2015-2018). Also, it brings the knowledge of some community parameters as species richness and composition not only for the whole area of the Vale Natural Reserve, but also for its different vegetation types, with no inclusion of environments outside this reserve. Furthermore, the presence of threatened species, the addition of four species to the current list, and the potential for new species to occur, reinforce the role of VNR as an important area for the protection of amphibian and reptile biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest.},

The order Anura represents the most diverse and widespread of the three extant amphibian orders (257 spp.). The anurofauna of Mexico’s tropical dry forest ecosystem host a high proportion of the species and endemism registered in the country. In terms of conservation, both dry forests and amphibians are at risk due to climate change because it is expected that as the temperature becomes higher and precipitation decreases, this vegetation type may experience water stress. We applied the MaxEnt algorithm to estimate the potential current and future (year 2070) geographic distribution patterns of 95 endemic Mexican anuran species inhabiting the country’s tropical dry forests by considering two representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP4.5/RCP8.5) and analyzed the potential distributional pattern changes. The results indicated that overall, species would experience enough of a significant warming effect to cause a reduction in the original distribution area, with 44% of species losing an average of 50% of their original range (9 spp. in threatened category); additionally, 22% of the species in the dry forest ecosystem will experience an average increase of almost 50% in their original area, two species will lose more than 80% of their range, and one will disappear.},

   abstract = {Abstract. Allobates paleovarzensis is a diurnal leaf-litter anuran of the Dendrobatoidea superfamily inhabiting Amazonian forests. Based on behavioral field observations, conducted between 2008-2017 at three localities, we describe the courtship, mating, parental care behavior and territoriality of the species. Vocal activity is more intense in the morning and during the rainy season. Resident males respond aggressively to other males that invade their territories, whereas females are not territorial. Females are attracted by the advertisement call of males and enter their territories to breed. The male courtship call has a lower frequency than the advertisement call, indicating that males can modulate the frequency characteristics of their vocalizations. Amplexus stimulates the release of oocytes by females. Males attend multiple egg clutches within their territories and transport tadpoles on their backs to aquatic habitats. Males carry up to 60 tadpoles on a single transport event-the largest number ever recorded for Allobates. We did not record male nor female cannibalism of tadpoles. In summary, we found that Allobates paleovarzensis is a polygamous species with uniparental care performed by the male, complex courtship behavior, high fecundity, and territoriality related to male competition for space and females.},

   abstract = {Understanding the response of species with differing life-history traits to habitat edges and habitat conversion helps predict their likelihood of persistence across changing landscape. In Brazil's Atlantic Forest, we evaluated frog richness and abundance by breeding guild at four distances from the edge of a reserve: i) 200 m inside the forest, ii) 50 m inside the forest, iii) at the forest edge, and iv) 50 m inside three different converted habitats (coffee plantation, non-native Eucalyptus plantation, and abandoned pastures, hereafter matrix types). By sampling a dry and a wet season, we recorded 622 individual frogs representing 29 species, of which three were undescribed. Breeding guild (i.e. bromeliad, leaf-litter, and water-body breeders) was the most important variable explaining frog distributions in relation to edge effects and matrix types. Leaf-litter and bromeliad breeders decreased in richness and abundance from the forest interior toward the matrix habitats. Water-body breeders increased in richness toward the matrix and remained relatively stable in abundance across distances. Number of large trees (i.e. DBH > 15 cm) and bromeliads best explained frog richness and abundance across distances. Twenty species found in the interior of the forest were not found in any matrix habitat. Richness and abundance across breeding guilds were higher in the rainy season but frog distributions were similar across the four distances in the two seasons. Across matrix types, leaf-litter species primarily used Eucalyptus plantations, whereas water-body species primarily used coffee plantations. Bromeliad breeders were not found inside any matrix habitat. Our study highlights the importance of primary forest for bromeliad and leaf-litter breeders. We propose that water-body breeders use edge and matrix habitats to reach breeding habitats along the valleys. Including life-history characteristics, such as breeding guild, can improve predictions of frog distributions in response to edge effect and matrix types, and can guide more effective management and conservation actions.},

All measurements were repeated in two unused quadrats (without burrows) to evaluate the available microhabitat (n=72). The burrows are built in specific areas of the habitat with a higher percentage of grass, taller herbs, lower density of shrubs and low shaded sites than the founded at control sites. Based on three-dimensional models of the interior of the burrow (n=15), we observed that all of them were constructed with an elliptical opening that opens into a narrow channel perpendicular to the ground. Channels had a mean maximum diameter of 38 mm and a mean minimum diameter of 18 mm. The mean length of the burrows is 182 mm, and the mean volume is 95 mL.},

   abstract = {Jumping consists of a series of complex movements with more variability in landing than in take-off. Different modes have been described concerning the landing phase, which seems to be linked to the general phylogenetic relationships of anuran groups. For example, the belly hit has been recorded in the basal-most living frog family Leiopelmatidae. Here we used high-speed videography to observe the role of hand and foot digits in landing behavior in ten species of neotropical anurans exhibiting different locomotor modes. We also calculated the time-lapse of each jump. We hypothesize that the role of digits can be pivotal to many anuran species during terrestrial landing. We also present data on the comparative anatomy of digits and those parts of the hands and feet involved in landing. Our video records show that landing through hand hit among anurans is performed with the distal curved phalanges of the hand digits. The morphological results show that all species surveyed, even the walker ones, exhibit distally curved phalanges, in lateral view. Movements of the distal phalanges of the hand are a key to understanding landing in anurans. All digits must be resistant to compression, since all the weight of the body falls on them. Digit hit seems to be action-driven by an elastic mechanism, which could indicate the activation, for example, of the flexor digitorum communis muscle. Landing in terrestrial frogs like Rhinella arenarum and Leptodactylus chaquensis follows a highly coordinated and synchronic pattern, with a longer time-lapse to complete each jump. Arboreal jumping frogs like Scinax fuscovarius and Boana riojana and semiaquatic hoppers like Pleurodema borellii and Physalaemus biligonigerus tend to be asynchronic and uncoordinated, but with a shorter time-lapse to complete each jump.},

   abstract = {Geographic patterns of species richness ultimately arise through the processes of speciation, extinction, and dispersal, but relatively few studies consider evolutionary and biogeographic processes in explaining these diversity patterns. One explanation for high tropical species richness is that many species-rich clades originated in tropical regions and spread to temperate regions infrequently and more recently, leaving little time for species richness to accumulate there (assuming similar rates of diversification in temperate and tropical regions). However, the major clades of anurans (frogs) and salamanders may offer a compelling counterexample. Most salamander families are predominately temperate in distribution, but the one primarily tropical clade (Bolitoglossinae) contains nearly half of all salamander species. Similarly, most basal clades of anurans are predominately temperate, but one largely tropical clade (Neobatrachia) contains ∼96% of anurans. In this article, I examine patterns of diversification in frogs and salamanders and their relationship to large-scale patterns of species richness in amphibians. I find that diversification rates in both frogs and salamanders increase significantly with decreasing latitude. These results may shed light on both the evolutionary causes of the latitudinal diversity gradient and the dramatic but poorly explained disparities in the diversity of living amphibian clades. © 2007 by The University of Chicago.

   abstract = {Current patterns of biodiversity distribution result from a combination of historical and contemporary processes. Here, we compiled checklists of amphibian species to assess the roles of long-term climate stability (Quaternary oscillations), contemporary environmental gradients and geographical distance as determinants of change in amphibian taxonomic and phylogenetic composition in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We calculated beta diversity as both variation in species composition (CBD) and phylogenetic differentiation (PBD) among the assemblages. In both cases, overall beta diversity was partitioned into two basic components: species replacement and difference in species richness. Our results suggest that the CBD and PBD of amphibians are determined by spatial turnover. Geographical distance, current environmental gradients and long-term climatic conditions were complementary predictors of the variation in CBD and PBD of amphibian species. Furthermore, the turnover components between sites from different regions and between sites within the stable region were greater than between sites within the unstable region. On the other hand, the proportion of beta-diversity due to species richness difference for both CBD and PBD was higher between sites in the unstable region than between sites in the stable region. The high turnover components from CBD and PBD between sites in unstable vs stable regions suggest that these distinct regions have different biogeographic histories. Sites in the stable region shared distinct clades that might have led to greater diversity, whereas sites in the unstable region shared close relatives. Taken together, these results indicate that speciation, environmental filtering and limited dispersal are complementary drivers of beta-diversity of amphibian assemblages in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.},

To better understand the importance of edge effects on amphibians in a forested landscape, we sampled the distribution of populations along drift fences placed perpendicular to silvicultural edges of varying contrast in central Maine. Within the community of amphibians sampled (14 species), salamanders generally were more sensitive to even‐aged harvesting and associated edge effects than were anurans, but forest habitat generalists and specialists were identified within both groups. We conservatively estimated the depth of edge effects at 25–35 m for a subset of management‐sensitive species (Plethodon cinereus, Ambystoma maculatum, A. laterale, and Rana sylvatica). An index of edge contrast, calculated using ambient light penetration levels, was valuable in predicting the magnitude of edge effects among sites that included silvicultural edges of different age and origin (old field plantations versus recent clearcuts). Some structural microhabitat variables relevant to forest management were identified as potentially limiting to amphibians near forest edges, including canopy cover, litter cover, and a measure of stumps, snags, and their root channels. Our observations are consistent with the results of other work on biotic edge effects in the eastern United States and suggest that impacts from intensive forest management practices extend beyond the boundaries of harvested stands.Efectos de Bordes Silviculturales en la Distribución y Abundancia de Anfibios en MaineLos anfibios comparten diversas characterísticas biológicas que pueden ser la causa de que sean sensitivos a transiciones abruptas en microhábitats y microclimas que ocurren a lo largo de los bordes de bosques. Para entender mejor la importancia de los efectos de bordes en anfibios en un paisaje boscoso, muestreamos la distribución de poblaciones a lo largo de vallas de desvío colocadas perpendicularmente a bordes silviculturales de contrastes variantes en la parte central de Maine, USA. Dentro de la comunidad de anfibios muestreados (14 spp), las salamandras generalmente fueron más sensitivas a la tala de edad constante y efectos asociados al borde que los anuros, pero tanto especies generalistas y especialistas de hábitat boscoso fueron identificadas dentro de ambos grupos. Conservativamente estimamos la profundidad del efecto de borde a 25–35m para un subset de especies sensitivas al manejo (Plethodon cinereus, Ambystoma maculatum, A. Laterale y Rana sylvatica). Un índice de constraste de borde, calculado usando niveles de penetración de luz ambiental fue valioso para predecir la magnitud de los efectos de borde entre sitios que incluyeron bordes silviculturales a diferentes edades y origenes (plantaciones viejas contra clareados recientes). Algunas variables estructurales de microhábitat relevantes para el manejo forestal fueron identificadas como potencialmente limitantes para anfibios cercanos a los bordes de bosques, incluyendo la cobertura del dosel, cobertura de hojarasca y una medición de varas, tocones y sus canales de raíces. Nuestras obsevaciones son consistentes con los resultados de otro trabajo en efectos bióticos de borde en el este de los Estados Unidos y sugieren que los impactos de prácticas de manejo forestal intensivo se extienden mas allá de los límites de los sitios cosechados.},

   abstract = {Habitat loss is the greatest threat to the persistence of forest-dependent amphibians, but it is not the only factor influencing species occurrences. The composition of the surrounding matrix, structure of stream networks, and topography are also important landscape characteristics influencing amphibian distributions. Tropical forests have high diversity and endemism of amphibians, but little is known about the specific responses of many of these species to landscape features. In this paper, we quantify the response of amphibian species and communities to landscape-scale characteristics in streams within the fragmented Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We surveyed amphibian communities during a rainy season in 50 independent stream segments using Standardized Acoustic and Visual Transect Sampling (active) and Automated Acoustic Recorders (passive) methods. We developed a hierarchical multi-species occupancy model to quantify the influence of landscape-scale characteristics (forest cover, agriculture, catchment area, stream density, and slope) on amphibian occurrence probabilities while accounting for imperfect detection of species using the two survey methods. At the community level, we estimated an overall mean positive relationship between amphibian occurrence probabilities and forest cover, and a negative relationship with agriculture. Catchment area and slope were negatively related with amphibian community structure (95% credible interval [CI] did not overlap zero). The species-level relationships with landscape covariates were highly variable but showed similar patterns to those at the community level. Species detection probabilities varied widely and were influenced by the sampling method. For most species, the active method resulted in higher detection probabilities than the passive approach. Our findings suggest that small streams and flat topography lead to higher amphibian occurrence probabilities for many species in Brazil's Atlantic Forest. Our results combined with land use and topographic maps can be used to make predictions of amphibian occurrences and distributions beyond our study area. Such projections can be useful to determine where to conduct future research and prioritize conservation efforts in human-modified landscapes.},

   abstract = {Aim: We investigate the spatiotemporal context of the diversification of Allobates, a widespread genus of Amazonian frogs with high species diversity particularly in western Amazonia. We tested if that diversity originated in situ or through repeated dispersals from other Amazonian areas and if this diversification took place during or after the Pebas system, a vast lacustrine system occupying most western Amazonia between 23 and 10 million years ago (Mya). Location: Amazonia. Taxon: Allobates (Anura: Aromobatidae). Methods: We gathered a spatially and taxonomically extensive sampling of mitochondrial DNA sequences from 932 Allobates specimens to delimit Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). Complete mitogenomes of these OTUs were assembled to reconstruct a time-calibrated phylogeny used to infer the historical and spatial origin of the Amazonian Allobates lineages. Results: Phylogenetic analyses and ancestral area reconstruction suggested that most of the western Amazonian lineages resulted from in situ diversification and that these events occurred between the inferred origin of the genus (25 Mya) and 10 Mya, with a possible peak between 14 and 10 Mya. Dispersal among areas mostly occurred from western Amazonia towards the Brazilian and the Guiana Shields. Closely related Allobates OTUs display an allopatric pattern of distribution, matching interfluves delimited by modern Amazonian rivers. Main Conclusions: In western Amazonia, diversification of Allobates appears to have been simultaneous with the last stages of the Pebas system (14–10 Mya). Subsequently (within the last 10 Mya), modern Amazonian river courses shaped the distribution pattern of Allobates species and possibly promoted allopatric speciation.},

Vocalization is an important biological aspect related to the reproduction and social behavior of the anurans. This is the first study with behavior and calls for the rocket frog, Allobates olfersioides (Lutz, 1925) and we record the territorial and courtship behavior in ethogram, describe and analyze its vocal repertoire and evaluate the climatic influence on the acoustic activity of the species. We observed 18 males of A. olfersioides by animal focal method, recording all individual activities for ten minutes to calculate the frequency of each action exhibited. Additionally, we played a previously recorded advertisement call to individual male frogs for analyze the territorial responses displayed by individual males during the work. For this anuran, we recorded 11 distinct behaviors and analyzed 14 advertisement calls that demonstrated that the call of A. olfersioides is a simple call composed of a single non-pulsed note, the call duration had a mean of 0.02s, the mean of intercall interval was of 0.35s and the dominant frequency presented a mean of 5.67 kHz. The period of vocal activity was recorded during almost all months of the study (November 2015 to October 2016), except November and December, where the individuals presented acoustic inactivity. We believe that A. olfersioides presents a continuous reproduction (approximately 10 months), due to the absence of vocalizations during the driest months in November and December. Concerning the behavioral activities, A. olfersioides presents territorialist behavior patterns similar to other species of Aromobatidae, demonstrating the importance of the acoustic and visual signals exhibited by this anuran species of the Atlantic Forest.},

   abstract = { ABSTRACT  Although effects of forest management on amphibians are relatively well studied, few studies have examined how these practices affect egg deposition by adults, which can impact population recruitment. We quantified the effects of 4 canopy tree‐retention treatments on amphibian oviposition patterns in clusters of 60‐L aquatic mesocosms located in each treatment. We also related aquatic and terrestrial biophysical parameters in treatment plots to oviposition patterns. Cope's gray treefrogs ( Hyla chrysoscelis ) deposited more egg masses in clear‐cut and 25–50% tree‐retention treatments than in controls. In contrast, mountain chorus frogs ( Pseudacris brachyp***hona ) deposited more egg masses in unharvested control and 75% retention treatments than in clear‐cut or 25–50% retention treatments. Spotted salamanders ( Ambystoma maculatum ) only deposited eggs in 75% retention treatments and controls. The number of egg masses deposited by mountain chorus frogs was positively related to canopy cover and negatively related to water temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen, whereas we noted the opposite relationships for Cope's gray treefrogs. We did not detect a relationship between the number of egg masses deposited by any species and the distance of mesocosms to either the nearest mature closed‐canopy forest or to the nearest natural amphibian breeding pool. The impacts of the silvicultural treatments we studied were species‐specific and depended on the amount of trees removed. In areas where protection of spotted salamander and mountain chorus frog breeding habitat is a priority, we recommend harvests retain at least 75% of the canopy. Our results also suggest that retention of 25–50% of canopy trees surrounding amphibian breeding pools has little conservation benefit. },

We determined occurrence patterns and habitat composition in 24 sites, half of which harboring established populations of the species. Landscape composition had clear effects on species occurrence.

Landscape composition was mostly strongly related to occurrence patterns when measured at the largest spatial scale considered (search radius = 3 km).

   abstract = {<p>Vernal ponds are often treated as protected environments receiving special regulation and management. Within the landscapes where they are found, forest vegetation frequently dominates surrounding uplands and can grow to overtop and shade pond basins. Two bodies of research offer differing views of the role of forest canopy for vernal pond systems. Studies of landscape conversion suggest that removing forest overstory within uplands can cause local extinctions of amphibians by altering terrestrial habitat or hindering movement. Studies of canopy above pond basins imply an opposite relationship; encroachment of overstory vegetation can be associated with local extinctions potentially via changes in light, thermal, and food resource environments. Unresolved uncertainties about the role of forest canopy reveal significant gaps in our understanding of wetland species distributions and dynamics. Any misunderstanding of canopy influences is simultaneously important to managers because current practices emphasize promoting or conserving vegetation growth particularly within buffers immediately adjacent to ponds. We evaluated this apparent contradiction by conducting a landscape‐scale, long‐term experiment using 14 natural vernal ponds. Tree felling at six manipulated ponds was limited in spatial scope but was nevertheless effective in increasing water temperature. Compared with eight control ponds, manipulated ponds maintained more amphibian species during five years post‐manipulation. There was little evidence that any species was negatively influenced, and the reproductive effort of species for which we estimated egg inputs maintained pretreatment population densities in manipulated compared with control ponds. Overall, our experiment shows that a carefully circumscribed reduction of overhead forest canopy can enhance the capacity of vernal ponds to support wildlife diversity and suggests a scale dependence of canopy influences on amphibians. These findings have implications for the connection between current wetland management practices and the goals of wetland stewardship and conservation of wetland‐dependent species.</p>},

They contain valuable timber species but are threatened by farming and mining activities. The objective of this study was to describe canopy opening and light relations in two seasonally deciduous dry forests on slopes and limestone outcrops, in the Paranã valley at the northeastern region of the Goiás state, Brazil. The studied forests were in the Fazenda Sabonete in Iaciara-Go and Fazenda Forquilha in Guarani-GO. Woody plants were sampled in 25 (20 x 20 m) plots in each forest. In the Sabonete forest 40 species, 705 ind./ha-1 with a basal area of 15.78 m²/ha-1 were found, while in Forquilha there were 55 species, 956 ind./ha-1 with a basal area of 24.76 m²/ha-1. Using hemispherical photographic techniques, 25 black and white photographs were taken at each site, during the dry season, totaling 50 photographs. These were taken at the beginning of each vegetation-sampling plot. The photographs were scanned in grey tones and saved as 'Bitmap'. The canopy opening and leaf area index (LAI) were calculated using the software Winphot. The mean canopy opening was 54.0% (±9.36) for Fazenda Sabonete and 64.6% (±11.8) in Fazenda Forquilha, with both sites presenting significant differences in the opening estimates (P < 0.05). Their floristic richness and structure also differed with the more open canopy forest, Forquilha, being richer and denser, suggesting the need for further studies on species-environment relationships in these forests.

Not all amphibian species were negatively affected by the presence of predatory fish: those having either large bodies or clutch size co-occurred with predatory fish more frequently than those with small bodies or clutch size.

Terrestrial habitats surrounding wetlands are critical foraging areas for temperate anurans. We investigated plant community changes in two old fields invaded by Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica) and the foraging success of Green frogs (Rana clamitans) in invaded and non-invaded portions of those fields. Within each field, vegetation data were recorded in quadrats located along two transects bisecting the invasion fronts. We placed frogs in 'foraging buckets' along transects and measured their change in mass over a 38 h period. There were significant changes in vegetation structure and composition associated with Japanese knotweed invasion. Diverse assemblages of native plants that covered non-invaded plots were absent from areas invaded by Japanese knotweed. There was also a significant change in vegetation architecture between invaded and non-invaded habitats. Change in frog mass declined significantly along transects, with most frogs in non-invaded plots gaining mass and no frogs in invaded plots gaining mass. Most frogs from non-invaded plots but only two from invaded plots defecated shortly after removal from foraging buckets (verification of recent feeding). We hypothesize that Japanese knotweed invasions degrade terrestrial habitat quality for frogs by indirectly reducing arthropod abundance. Nonnative plant invasions may be another factor contributing to amphibian population declines. © Springer 2005.},

   abstract = {Non-native invasive plants are a significant threat to native biodiversity as they change community structure and ecosystem processes and it is becoming imperative that these invasive plants are controlled. We investigated the response of wetland invertebrates to glyphosate chemical control of an introduced tree, grey willow (Salix cinerea), in a before-after-control-impact (BACI) experiment within a New Zealand wetland. Our findings suggest that control of grey willow resulted in significant increases in the abundance of invertebrates within 2 years after herbicide application. Analysis of beetle communities revealed that the abundance and species richness of herbivorous and predacious beetles, the abundance of introduced species, and the species richness of native and introduced species were all significantly higher in the herbicide-treated plots than in the unsprayed plots. The composition of the beetle community separated into two clear groups—plots before spray/no spray and plots 1 and 2 years after herbicide application. We suggest that the beetle compositional changes were driven by complex changes in vegetation associated with the canopy collapse of grey willow trees and the initial influx of introduced plant species, predominantly weedy annuals and perennials, after willow control. Restoration via invasive plant control can promote the reestablishment of invertebrate communities typical of native wetlands, but their long-term sustainability is contingent on prevention of grey willow reinvasion and reestablishment of the native plant habitat.},

   abstract = {Large-scale field patterns are a fundamental source of inferences on processes responsible for variation in species richness among habitats. We examined species richness of larval amphibian communities in 37 ponds over seven years on the Univ. of Michigan’s E. S. George Reserve. Ordination of the community incidence matrix indicated a strong major axis of variation in species associations that was correlated with pond hydroperiod, surface area and forest canopy cover. Communities were significantly nested with those species found in ponds with high canopy cover, small area and short hydroperiod being nested subsets of those found in ponds with contrasting characteristics. Presence of fish had strong negative effects on species richness; relaxation of this effect also was apparent when fish were extirpated from ponds by drought. We employed a model selection analysis to identify the most appropriate statistical model for predicting the long-term average species richness of these ponds from local abiotic and biotic (predator and competitor density) factors. A model including only the abiotic factors was overwhelmingly superior for the anurans; hierarchical partitioning indicated that area and canopy cover alone accounted for over 70% of the independent effects of predictor variables. The global model including both abiotic and biotic factors was the best supported model for the caudates, and correspondingly hierarchical partitioning suggested that area, hydroperiod, invertebrate predators and caudate biomass all accounted for 916% of the independent effects. Overall, biotic factors accounted for much less of the variation in species richness than abiotic factors. The patterns in larger, open-canopy ponds provided little evidence of competitive effects on species richness, though there were patterns consistent with competitive effects in small, closed-canopy ponds. The unusual temporal and spatial extent of these data enabled us to critically evaluate ideas regarding patterns in larval amphibian communities, and the effects of area, disturbance (hydroperiod) and productivity (canopy cover) on species richness of these communities. These results have important implications to the conservation of amphibian species richness in freshwater wetlands, which are among the most threatened ecosystems worldwide.},

We estimated climatic and habitat suitability for all species under historical and future (2050) conditions, using niche modeling and forest cover maps from a comprehensive land-use model. We contrasted a pessimistic land-use scenario, with little change in forest cover, with an optimistic scenario, with forest gain through restoration of “legal reserve” areas. Our models show that climate change will have species-specific effects on anurans, increasing climatic suitability for seven species, but decreasing for three. For these three species, we predict that forest gain can compensate the negative impact of climate change, increasing overall environmental suitability.

   abstract = {Despite the impressive growth of knowledge on the phylogenetic systematics of dart-poison frogs and their relatives (Dendrobatoidea) over the past decade, many problems remain to be addressed. We analyzed up to 189 phenomic characters (morphology, behavior, defensive chemicals) and 15 mitochondrial and nuclear loci scored for 564 dendrobatoid and outgroup terminals, including 76 newly sequenced terminals and > 20 previously unanalyzed species, using tree-alignment and the parsimony optimality criterion in the program POY v.5.1.1 and additional analyses of the implied alignment using TNT v.1.5. Even though data coverage was highly heterogeneous, the strict consensus of 639 optimal trees is highly resolved and we detected only one instance of wildcard behavior involving a small clade of outgroup species. The monophyly of the median lingual process (MLP) possessing genus Anomaloglossus is decisively refuted, with the cis-Andean species being sister to Rheobates within Aromobatidae and the trans-Andean species nested within Hyloxalinae, implying two independent origins of the structure in Dendrobatoidea. Although this result was unexpected, it is not surprising given that the MLP evolved at least five times in Asian and African ranoids, including Arthroleptidae, Dicroglossidae, Mantellidae, and Rhacophoridae and either once in the most recent common ancestor of the massive clade Victoranura followed by independent losses or multiple times within component lineages. We restrict Anomaloglossus to the cis-Andean MLP-possessing species, describe a new genus for the trans-Andean MLP-possessing species, and resurrect Paruwrobates for its sister group, which includes Dendrobates andinus (formerly Ameerega), D. erythromos (formerly Hyloxalus and, until recently, Ameerega), and Prostherapis whymperi (formerly Hyloxalus). We also transfer Dendrobates maculatus from Ameerega to Epipedobates, making Ameerega an exclusively cis-Andean group. We describe two new species of the trans-Andean MLP-possessing genus-one from Cerro Tacarcuna, near the Colombo-Panamanian border, and the other from 800-900 m elevation on the western versant of the Colombian Cordillera Occidental (Cauca Department)-bringing the total number of species in the genus to seven. The discrete, round, white to yellowish-brown dots found on the venter of the new species from Cerro Tacarcuna and at least one other trans-Andean MLP-possessing species are formed by large, ellipsoid, densely distributed (up to 80 glands/mm2) granular glands. Although specimens of the new species from Cerro Tacarcuna exuded a noxious milky substance when handled, lipophilic alkaloids were not detected. In addition to the unexpected placement of the trans-Andean MLP-possessing species, major findings include the unexpected placement of Colostethus ruthveni and its undescribed sister species (the "C." ruthveni group) within Dendrobatinae as sister of the newly recognized tribe Dendrobatini (all dendrobatines except Phyllobates and the "C." ruthveni group). We describe a new genus for C. argyrogaster and C. fugax to remedy the paraphyly of Colostethus caused by the placement of those species as sister to Ameerega. Our evidence rejects the sister group relationship of Dendrobates + Oophaga in favor of Dendrobates + Adelphobates, which is consistent with their uniquely low diploid chromosome number of 2n = 18 (2n = 20 in Oophaga). With the exception of Anomaloglossus and Colostethus, all other genera are monophyletic. We recognize several monophyletic species groups-including the Atlantic Forest, trans-Andean, and 22-chromosome groups within Allobates, the An. stepheni, An. megacephalus, and An. beebei groups in Anomaloglossus, the C. latinasus (formed by the C. inguinalis and C. latinasus clades) and C. fraterdanieli groups within Colostethus, and the Am. braccata and Am. rubriventris groups within Ameerega-identify unambiguously optimized phenomic synapomorphies, and summarize patterns in the evolution of the diploid chromosome number, swelling of Finger IV in males, relative length of Fingers II and III, length of Finger V, and testicular and intestinal pigmentation. Finally, we address criticisms of the current taxonomy of Neotropical poison frogs and their relatives, concluding that they are either overstated, misguided, or false, and that the current system of names better communicates knowledge of the diversity of these frogs. Our results highlight the importance of increased taxon sampling, and we conclude by identifying key species to include in future phylogenetic analyses.},

   abstract = {Descriptions of amphibian habitat, both aquatic and terrestrial, often include plants as characteristics but seldom is it understood whether and how those plants affect amphibian ecology. Understanding how plants affect amphibian populations is needed to develop strategies to combat declines of some amphibian populations. Using a systematic approach, we reviewed and synthesized available literature on the effects of plants on pond-breeding amphibians during the aquatic and terrestrial stages of their life cycle. Our review highlights that plant communities can strongly influence the distribution, abundance, and performance of amphibians in multiple direct and indirect ways. We found three broad themes of plants' influence on amphibians: plants can affect amphibians through effects on abiotic conditions including the thermal, hydric, and chemical aspects of an amphibian's environment; plants can have large effects on aquatic life stages through effects on resource quality and abundance; and plants can modify the nature and strength of interspecific interactions between amphibians and other species – notably predators. We synthesized insights gained from the literature to discuss how plant community management fits within efforts to manage amphibian populations and to guide future research efforts. While some topical areas are well researched, we found a general lack of mechanistic and trait-based work which is needed to advance our understanding of the drivers through which plants influence amphibian ecology. Our literature review reveals the substantial role that plants can have on amphibian ecology and the need for integrating plant and amphibian ecology to improve research and management outcomes for amphibians.},

Here we investigate whether an invasive shrub, Lonicera maackii, impacts native amphibians and evaluate evidence for the role of invasive plant-induced alteration of forest understory microclimate as a mechanism driving amphibian responses to L. maackii invasion. We sampled amphibian communities in forest plots with high or low density of L. maackii, and monitored microclimate (temperature and humidity at ground level) in the same forest plots. Amphibian species richness and evenness were lower in invaded plots. Invasion also resulted in shifts in amphibian species composition. Mean daily maximum temperature and mean daily temperature were lower in invaded plots, and counts of the Green frog Lithobates clamitans were marginally negatively related to mean daily temperature. Our work illustrates how an invasive ecosystem engineer may affect native organisms with which it shares no trophic connection, and suggests that changes in microclimate may be one mechanism by which alien plants affect communities where they invade. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Invasive species may affect community diversity in several ways, causing species loss at local scales and promoting either biotic homogenization among sites within a region or increases in beta diversity among regions. If these losses or additions are restricted to specific functional groups or clades, it could mean the loss or modification of an ecosystem process, and cause important changes in native community structures. In this study, we assessed whether a bullfrog invasion is related to diversity changes in Atlantic Forest anuran communities. We compared communities from invaded and non-invaded sites, and tested for differences in composition and in the variability of composition, at both taxonomic and phylogenetic levels. The potential influence of pond and habitat features in our results was also assessed. We also tested if bullfrog invasion is promoting nestedness. We found no differences among anuran compositions from 57 invaded and non-invaded sites, across the three regions studied, either for taxonomic or for phylogenetic data. Habitat descriptors partially explained taxonomic composition. The taxonomic and phylogenetic compositions were also similar regarding dispersion variability. In addition, invaded sites did not show nested compositions from non-invaded sites. In sum, our results do not support the hypothesis that bullfrog invasion caused changes in diversity patterns of anuran communities. Our results contrast with studies conducted in other regions of the world, where invasive populations of bullfrogs seem to affect local native communities. In those places, bullfrogs find congeneric or confamilial species, which may be more affected by the invasion. In the Atlantic Forest, bullfrogs find suitable climatic conditions, and may face low biotic resistance since they find no congeneric species. These conditions may allow bullfrogs to coexist with native species without changes in diversity.},

The information gap is particularly acute in tropical landscapes that simultaneously host the greatest and most imperiled amphibian fauna on Earth. We installed 125 artificial ponds at different distances from forest fragments embedded in an agricultural matrix in southeastern Brazil. Constructed ponds attracted 13 anuran species; ponds at the forest fragment-matrix transition hosted a greater abundance and higher species richness of frogs and toads than those installed either far from or well within forest fragments. Forest fragments larger than 70 ha in agricultural areas harbored more individuals than smaller fragments.

Forest fragmentation makes the environment more susceptible to invasive species occupation. Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) was introduced into Brazil in the seventeenth century; and in the second half of the twentieth century, its natural regeneration increased the density of individuals, compromising the recruitment of many native species. This study investigated the impact of A. heterophyllus invasion on the diversity and tree structure component at the edge of an Atlantic Forest fragment, in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Two transect-type plots were set up with 10 m x 100 m (1,000 m 2), being divided into 10 subplots of 10 m x 10 m, with a total sampling area of 2,000 m 2. Trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) equals to or greater than 5 cm were tagged and DBH and total height measured. The following phytosociological parameters were estimated: Frequency (F), Density (D), Dominance (Do), Importance (IV) and Coverage (CV) Values. In total, 191 tree individuals were sampled. Invasive species made up more than 35% of the entire vegetation structure in the studied environment, ending in first place in terms of Importance Value (IV = 35.62%). Low floristic wealth seems to have favored the A. heterophyllus invasion process in the community, showing the need for an effective control of the species for the native genetic heritage protection.},

However, the implementation of PAs does not always mitigate the impacts of human occupation such as biological invasions and climatic changes. We evaluated the effect of the invasion of Artocarpus heterophyllus, the jackfruit, over Atlantic Forest PAs, under the influence of climate changes and across scales. The environmental suitability of jackfruit for preindustrial, future (2080), and delta (= future − preindustrial) was used to establish the risk of invasiveness. To validate the hypothesis that PAs have higher jackfruit invasiveness than usual in preindustrial, future, and delta periods, we used a null model. We conducted a phytosociological study in Guarirú Natural Heritage Private Reserve (NHPR) for evaluating the effect of jackfruit on species richness. The Atlantic Forest PAs have higher jackfruit environmental suitability than expected for both preindustrial, future, and delta periods. In Guarirú NHPR, the presence of jackfruit was inversely proportional to the species richness. The combined effect of jackfruit invasion and climatic changes showed that the Atlantic Forest PAs are threatened by the effect of jackfruit competitive pressure over native species, thus dominating ecosystems both by density and biomass, in preindustrial, and under climate changes. Guarirú NHPR is already losing its biodiversity through the presence of jackfruit, needing management interventions. We strongly recommend that to combat the occurrence of jackfruit in Atlantic Forest PAs, management interventions should be taken to control its persistence, also delineating its role inside the community structure.},

   abstract = {Plants serve as both basal resources and ecosystem engineers, so plant invasion may exert trophic influences on consumers both via bottom-up processes and by altering the environmental context in which trophic interactions occur. To determine how these mechanisms affect a native predator we used a mark-recapture study in eight pairs of 58- m2 field enclosures to measure the influence of Japanese stilt grass invasion on 3200 recently metamorphosed American toads. Toad survivorship was lower in invaded habitats despite abiotic effects that favor amphibians. Prey densities were also lower in invaded habitats, but growth was unaffected. Frequent spider predation events in invaded habitats led us to use factorial field cage manipulations of stilt grass and lycosid spiders to determine if invasion increases predation rates. Spiders persisted at higher densities in the presence of stilt grass, and toad survival was lowest in cages with both grass and spiders. Invasion alone did not significantly reduce toad survival. Our results demonstrate that despite prey reductions and abiotic effects, it is increased spider persistence that reduces toad survival in invaded habitats. Invasion therefore affects resident forest floor consumers by modifying trophic interactions between native species, causing structurally mediated reductions in intraguild predation rates among spiders, with cascading implications for toad survival. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Little is known about mechanisms that exclude species from some sections of the gradient while allowing persistence in others. I addressed this question by manipulating shading in 740-l outdoor mesocosms and measuring several ecologically-relevant traits in three species of amphibian larva (Rana temporaria and Triturus alpestris, generalists occupying the entire gradient; and Hyla arborea, a specialist in open habitats). Shading caused delayed development, but had no effect on survival and increased the growth rate of R. temporaria. Body and tail color were darker in the shade. Plasticity in morphological shape, consisting of reduced gut width and increased tail size under shaded conditions, may reflect poor food availability and low dissolved oxygen. The canopy generalist R. temporaria increased activity in the shade, spent more time basking in shallow water, and maintained high larval performance. Unexpectedly, the specialist H. arborea was also highly plastic. These results describe extensive phenotypic plasticity induced by shade, and highlight traits that may influence performance along the canopy gradient. © 2011 The Authors.},

In the course of direct observations of the communities of fallow lands and pits, four groups of phytocenoses were identified, reflecting successive stages of succession: gramineous phytocenoses with maintaining their status during the study period; gramineous phytocenoses with subsequent transition to the meadow stage; and early meadow and formed meadow phytocenoses. The temporal dynamics of their species composition and alpha diversity was studied. Differences in indicators of diversity of communities associated with their successional age and physicochemical parameters of soils (agrozems and technozems) were established. Communities of agrozems and technozems differed in the rate of change in alpha diversity indicators. The increase in these indicators occurred significantly faster on agrozems than on technozems. The transition between stages was not accompanied by a significant increase in the diversity of communities on technozems.},

The prevailing climate is modified first by local weather conditions (particularly cloud cover), and then by the vegetation. Crucially, the structure of the canopy controls the quantity, quality, spatial and temporal distribution of light. It also influences local precipitation and air movements. Combined, these factors determine the air humidity, temperature and to some extent the soil moisture conditions at any given point within the forest. Many silvicultural methods depend on manipulation of the forest canopy in order to create conditions favouring the survival and growth of desirable plants. These include tree seedlings, which may be the next commercial crop, and non-marketable species that have a conservation value. Light penetration also affects animal Summary The forest canopy is one of the chief determinants of the microhabitat within the forest. It affects plant growth and survival, hence determining the nature of the vegetation, and wildlife habitat. A plethora of different techniques have been devised to measure the canopy. Evaluation of the literature reveals confusion over what is actually being measured. This paper distinguishes two basic types of measurement: canopy cover is the area of the ground covered by a vertical projection of the canopy, while canopy closure is the proportion of the sky hemisphere obscured by vegetation when viewed from a single point. The principal techniques used to measure canopy cover, canopy closure, and a number of related measures are described and discussed.

The optimistic scenario, based in a 0.5% increase in the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere, predicts an increase of up to 2 °C in the Earth's average temperature; in the pessimistic scenario, based on a 1% increase in the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere, temperature increase may reach 4 °C. Using these parameters, the occurrence points of the studied species registered in literature, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Predictions/GARP and Maximum entropy modeling of species geographic distributions/MaxEnt we developed models of present and future possible occurrence of each species, considering Earth's mean temperature by 2050 with the optimistic and the pessimistic scenarios of CO 2 emission. The results obtained show an alarming reduction in the area of possible occurrence of the species studied, as well as a shift towards southern areas of Brazil. Using GARP, on average, in the optimistic scenario this reduction is of 25% while in the pessimistic scenario it reaches 50%, and the species that will suffer the worst reduction in their possible area of occurrence are: Euterpe edulis, Mollinedia schottiana, Virola bicuhyba, Inga sessilis and Vochysia magnifica.

In particular, the Brazilian Forest Act, first drafted in 1934, has been fundamental in reducing deforestation and engaging private land owners in forest restoration initiatives. At the time of writing (December 2010), however, a proposal for major revision of the Brazilian Forest Act is under intense debate in the National Assembly, and we are deeply concerned about the outcome. On the basis of the analysis of detailed vegetation and hydrographic maps, we estimate that the proposed changes may reduce the total amount of potential areas for restoration in the Atlantic Forest by approximately 6 million hectares. As a radically different policy model, we present the Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact (AFRP), which is a group of more than 160 members that represents one of the most important and ambitious ecological restoration programs in the world. The AFRP aims to restore 15 million hectares of degraded lands in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome by 2050 and increase the current forest cover of the biome from 17% to at least 30%. We argue that not only should Brazilian lawmakers refrain from revising the existing Forest Law, but also greatly step up investments in the science, business, and practice of ecological restoration throughout the country, including the Atlantic Forest. The AFRP provides a template that could be adapted to other forest biomes in Brazil and to other megadiversity countries around the world. © 2011 Society for Ecological Restoration International.},

   abstract = {Study of the ecological and economic effects of invasive species has paralleled their progressively pervasive influence worldwide, yet their cultural impacts remain largely unexamined and therefore unrecognized. Unlike biological systems, where the ecological consequences of biological invasions are primarily negative, from an ethnoscientific standpoint, invasive species' impacts on cultural systems span a range of effects. Biological invasions affect cultural groups in myriad, often unpredictable and at times contradictory ways. This review groups case studies into a conceptual matrix suggesting three categorically different cultural impacts of invasive species. Culturally impoverishing invasive species precipitate the loss or replacement of culturally important native species and their associated cultural practices. Culturally enriching invasive species augment cultural traditions, through their inclusion in lexicons, narratives, foods, pharmacopoeias and other tangible and intangible ends. Culturally facilitating invasive species can provide continuity and reformulation of traditional ethnobiological practices. An understanding of the processes by which invasive biota become culturally enriching, facilitating, or impoverishing can contribute to articulating interdisciplinary programmes aimed at simultaneously conserving biological and cultural diversity. © 2008 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.},

We compiled matrices of species composition for four different phytogeographic formations and “Brejos de Altitude,” and analyzed them using clustering methods and Cladistic Analysis of Distributions and Endemism. Our results indicate that the anurofauna of these northeastern forest relicts is most similar in composition to the areas of the Atlantic Forest included in this study, and most dissimilar to the Amazon Forest, which leads us to affirm that events of biotic exchange were more frequent within the Atlantic Forest areas.},

This degree of disturbance, together with the increasing sprawl of cities towards the rural zone, greatly facilitates the entrance of domestic animals into these remnants. We used camera traps to compare the abundances of the domestic dog with a similarly sized native carnivore, the ocelot, in a 957-ha reserve of the Brazilian Atlantic forest in a landscape largely composed by pastures and agriculture. The dog was the most recorded species among all 17 mammal species "captured " by the cameras. Dog abundance (32 -38 dogs) and density (0.812 -1.813 dogs/km 2 ) were signifi cantly higher than that of the ocelot (n = 2 ocelots; density = 0.158 -0.347 ocelots/km 2 ). Although our result is restricted to a single study site, it is supported by an increasing number of recent studies, which have detected dogs inside other Atlantic forest reserves. Our study suggests, therefore, that this invasion might be more widespread than generally thought. The presence of the domestic dog is a threat to native fauna and constitutes an important edge effect of human presence at the rural zone. © 2012 by Walter de Gruyter.},

   abstract = {Aim: To examine how the genetic diversity of selected taxa of forest-dwelling small mammals is distributed between and within the major rain forest domains of Amazonia and Atlantic Forest and the intervening interior forests of Brazil, as inferred by the relationships between gene genealogies and geography. I also addressed the historical importance of the central Brazilian forests in connecting Amazon and Atlantic Forest populations of rodents and marsupials. Methods: I evaluated variation in the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to estimate the levels of sequence divergence between those taxa occurring throughout the Amazon, Atlantic Forest, and forests in the Cerrado and Caatinga regions. I inferred the hierarchical relationships between haplotypes, populations and formal taxa using the cladistic approach of maximum parsimony. I compared areas and the clades identified by superimposing cladograms on the geographical distribution of samples. The degree of concordance both in phylogeny and the depth of the nodes in these phylogenies, in addition to patterns of geographical distribution of clades, permitted me to make inferences on how, when and where the taxa differentiated. Results: Sequence similarity is often greater between samples from the Atlantic Forest and either Amazon or central Brazilian forests than it is within each of the two rain forest domains. The Atlantic Forest clades are either not reciprocally monophyletic or are the sister group to all the other clades. There is some indication of northern and southern components in the Atlantic Forest. Given the geographical distribution of clades and the relatively deep levels of divergence, the central Brazilian area does not behave as a separate region but is complementary to either Amazon or Atlantic Forest. Patterns of area relationships differ across taxa, suggesting that different processes and/or historic events affected the diversification within each lineage. Main conclusions: The Amazon and the Atlantic forests are not exclusive in terms of their small mammal faunas; both overlap broadly with taxa occurring in gallery forests and dry forests in central Brazil. Central Brazilian forests are an integral part of the evolutionary scenario of lowland small mammals, playing an important role as present and past habitats for rain forest species. Therefore, representatives from this area should always be included in analyses of the evolutionary history of lowland rain forest faunas. The incongruence of branching patterns among areas is in agreement with recent results presented for Neotropical passerine birds and indicates that a single hypothesis of Neotropical area relationships is unlikely. These findings reinforce the idea that speciation in the Neotropics will not be explained by any single model of vicariance or climatic changes.},

In less than 30 years, lionfish have dramatically expanded their distribution range to an area encompassing the eastern coast of the USA, Bermuda, the entire Caribbean region and the Gulf of Mexico. Until now, just a single sighting had been reported in the South Atlantic and it was questionable whether lionfish would invade this region like it has in the northwestern Atlantic. Here we report four new records of lionfish for the Brazilian coast, in the southwestern Atlantic. Two individuals were captured in mesophotic reefs underneath the Amazon river plume, one in an oceanic archipelago distant 350 km from Brazil’s tropical continental coast, and the fourth in the subtropical coast. The records in the Amazon and in the oceanic regions support previous inferences of lionfish invasion routes into the south Atlantic. The subtropical record, despite being considered too far away for a single larval dispersal event from the Caribbean, is recurrent and could be a result of aquarium releases.},

   abstract = {A common mesofilter approach to conservation of biological diversity and ecosystem function used in agricultural and urban landscapes is maintenance of wetlands and an undisturbed terrestrial buffer surrounding wetlands. Although it is generally accepted that forest buffers protect wetland-associated biological diversity and ecosystem function, the effectiveness and optimal spatial extent of buffers is still an area of debate. During 2007 and 2008 we surveyed amphibians and environmental conditions associated with 54 depression wetlands on the Delmarva Peninsula of Maryland, USA, to examine the role of forest buffers and wetland characteristics in structuring amphibian communities. Forest cover within a 50-m buffer surrounding wetlands was correlated (r = −0.81) with wetland pH but no other wetland characteristics. Wetland pH, canopy cover, hydroperiod, and adjacent forest cover were important predictors of wetland use by individual amphibian species, with many species more likely to occur at wetlands that dried late in the hydrological year and with open canopies. At least one common species preferred circumneutral pH and several restricted-distribution species preferred lower pH (<5). Contrary to expectations, relationships between species occurrence and adjacent forest cover were negative. Our results suggest that current regulations that provide buffers of 30 m or less do not provide adequate protection of wetland water chemistry but that forest encroachment into wetlands may be a threat to the integrity of amphibian communities and should be the target of monitoring, future research, and management efforts. © 2021 The Wildlife Society.},

We used 238 advertisement calls of 34 populations of Amazonian nurse frogs from two Amazonian rainforests with different vegetation density to test if tree density influences the evolution of acoustic parameters. We used PGLS to test for relationships between acoustic traits and phenotypic, environmental and geographic predictors. Spectral and temporal features of calls have an allometric relationship with body size. We found a novel quadratic relationship between note duration and body size. The allometric relationship between dominant frequency and body size and a direct effect of tree density indicates that the evolutionary trajectories of Amazonian nurse frogs follow a general macro-evolutionary pattern as in birds. The temporal features of calls have opposite evolutionary trajectories to those predicted by AAH; frogs from lower tree density environments emit longer notes and have higher note rates than those from denser-tree environments. Subtle differences between Amazonian forest types can drive acoustic diversification of temporal and spectral features of calls at micro-evolutionary scales.},

The 4-year old Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact (AFRP) aims to restore 15,000,000. ha of tropical forest in 40 years. The approaches and lessons learned appear transferable, and could help achieve the global restoration targets. Fundamental prerequisites for success include: effective technology undergoing continuous improvement, ongoing teaching, outreach and capacity-building efforts, presence of local intelligentsia, maintaining a clear and transparent legal environment, and presence of effective economic instruments and incentives for landowners. These prerequisites can be achieved by expanding and strengthening the network of stakeholders both in public and private forums that must be aware of macro-economic and social/cultural shifts and trends which may provide opportunities and impose constraints to further restoration activities. Finally, environmental regulations imposing habitat protection and restoration are usually beyond individual land-owners' possibilities and level of interest. Therefore, forest restoration, even in a biodiversity hotspot, must be approached as a potentially sustainable economic activity. Otherwise, private landowners, and most other stakeholders, will not persevere. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The success of species establishing viable populations outside their original extent depends primarily on favorable climatic conditions in the invasive ranges. Species distribution modeling (SDM) can thus be used to estimate potential habitat suitability for populations of invasive species. Here we review the status of six amphibian species with invasive populations in Brazil (four domestic species and two imported species). We (i) modeled the current habitat suitability and future potential distribution of these six focal species, (ii) reported on the disease status of Eleutherodactylus johnstonei and Phyllodytes luteolus, and (iii) quantified the acoustic overlap of P. luteolus and Leptodactylus labyrinthicus with three co-occurring native species. Our models indicated that all six invasive species could potentially expand their ranges in Brazil within the next few decades. In addition, our SDMs predicted important expansions in available habitat for 2 out of 6 invasive species under future (2100) climatic conditions. We detected high acoustic niche overlap between invasive and native amphibian species, underscoring that acoustic interference might reduce mating success in local frogs. Despite the American bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus being recognized as a potential reservoir for the frog-killing fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) in Brazil, we did not detect Bd in the recently introduced population of E. johnstonei and P. luteolus in the State of São Paulo.

The simplicity of the method and the open-accessibility of coveR can effectively extend the accessibility and applicability of DCP to a wider audience. Abstract: Digital cover photography (DCP) is an increasingly popular tool for estimating canopy cover and leaf area index (LAI). However, existing solutions to process canopy images are predominantly tailored for hemispherical photography, whereas open-access tools for DCP are lacking. We developed an R package (coveR) to support the whole processing of DCP images in an automated, fast, and reproducible way. The package functions, which are designed for step-by-step single-image analysis, can be performed sequentially in a pipeline while ensuring quality-checking of each processing step. A wrapper function ‘coveR()’ is also created to perform all the image processing workflow in a single function. A case study is presented to demonstrate the reliability of canopy attributes derived from coveR in pure beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) stands with variable canopy density and structure. Estimates of gap fraction and effective LAI from DCP were validated against reference measurements obtained from terrestrial laser scanning. By providing a simple, transparent, and flexible image processing procedure, coveR supported the use of DCP for routine measurements and monitoring of forest canopy attributes. This, combined with the possibility to implement DCP in many devices, including smartphones, micro-cameras, and remote trail cameras, can greatly expand the accessibility of the method also by non-experts.},

Nowhere is this more crucial than in tropical forests that harbor immense biodiversity, but have also undergone widespread deforestation over the past few decades. We performed a meta-analysis to investigate how biodiversity features respond to forest restoration across the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF), one of the most threatened biodiversity hotspots in the world. We assembled biodiversity in different metrics of structure and diversity features of three taxonomic groups (vascular plants, soil microorganisms, and invertebrates), generating a dataset with 2370 observations from 76 primary studies. We quantified the incomplete recovery of biodiversity (i.e., the rate of recovery to a pre-disturbance state) occurring during the restoration process, which we called the ‘recovery gap’. Our results revealed that forests undergoing restoration in the BAF show a recovery gap of 34% for structure features and 22% for diversity features in comparison to reference reforests, considering all taxonomic groups investigated. For vascular plants, soil microorganisms, and invertebrates the recovery gap ranged between 46 and 47%, 16–26%, and 4–7%, respectively. Overall, the recovery gap was influenced by the interaction of restoration actions (i.e., the past land use, restoration age and restoration approach – active and passive restoration), however, structure features responded more sensitively to the time elapsed since restoration started, while the recovery gap for diversity features depended more on the past land-use. Our study can help guide the prioritization of the aforenamed taxonomic groups in restoration, the regulation of potential biodiversity offsetting policies in the BAF, and understanding how coupled biodiversity features respond to the interaction of environmental conditions and restoration actions in a high fragmented tropical landscape.},

   abstract = {The use of simple terms to articulate ecological concepts can confuse ideological debates and undermine management efforts. This problem is particularly acute in studies of nonindigenous species, which alternatively have been called 'exotic', 'introduced', 'invasive' and 'naturalised', among others. Attempts to redefine commonly used terminology have proven difficult because authors are often partial to particular definitions. In an attempt to form a consensus on invasion terminology, we synthesize an invasional framework based on current models that break the invasion process into a series of consecutive, obligatory stages. Unlike previous efforts, we propose a neutral terminology based on this framework This 'stage-based' terminology can be used to supplement terms with ambiguous meanings (e.g. invasive, introduced, naturalized, weedy, etc.), and thereby improve clarity of future studies. This approach is based on the concept of 'propagule pressure' and has the additional benefit of identifying factors affecting the success of species at each stage. Under this framework, invasions can be more objectively understood as biogeographical, rather than taxonomic, phenomena; and author preferences in the use of existing terminology can be addressed. An example of this recommended protocol might be: 'We examined distribution data to contrast the characteristics of invasive species (stages IVa and V) and noninvasive species (stages III and IVb)'.},

Using state-of-the-art phylogenetic comparative methods, we show that successful invaders have fast traits, such as large and frequent clutches, at both establishment and spread stages. These results, together with recent findings in mammals and plants, support ‘fast advantage’ models and the importance of high potential population growth rate. Conversely, successful alien birds are bet-hedgers.

In this study, the feeding habits of three species of anurans (Rhinella fernandezae, Odontophrynus americanus and Physalaemus albonotatus) were compared between a soybean field and a native forest in Santa Fe Province, Argentina. Our dietary assessment is based on 124 individuals (47 R. fernandezae, 45 O. americanus and 32 P. albonotatus). Lepidopteran larvae were the predominant item in anuran diets from the soybean field, whereas collembola, isopods and snails prevailed in the diets from forests. Generally, the three anuran species shifted their diets as prey differs in the two environments, but R. fernandezae and P. albonotatus maintained a preference for a few prey types. Mean niche overlap in the soybean field was smaller than expected by chance, suggesting that the three anuran species are competing for limited resources. Trophic studies on other native anurans in agroecosystems should be a priority in conservation efforts due to their potential use as natural control agents, as well as for assessing the consequences of the broad conversion of natural forest to agricultural use in our region and throughout the world.},

   abstract = {Habitat loss or degradation due to land cover change is regarded as one of the main drivers of amphibian decline; therefore, it is imperative to assess the effects of land-cover change on this group of vertebrates. In this study, we analyze changes in alpha and beta diversity of amphibian communities found in five land-cover types: mountain cloud forest, tropical evergreen forest, shade coffee, milpa huasteca, and grazing areas; six samples sites were established for each land-cover type, separated at least one km away. The study was conducted in the northwest part of the state of Hidalgo, in a transition zone between the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Gulf of Mexico, which is a region rich in amphibian species. The results indicate that alpha diversity decreases with loss of canopy cover, this being high in mountain cloud forest, tropical evergreen forest, and Shade coffee, and low in milpa huasteca and grazing areas. The land-cover type with the highest species evenness was found in milpa huasteca and the lowest in. The highest beta diversity was observed among tropical evergreen forest and grazing areas. Mountain cloud forest contains both exclusive species and the highest number of species currently regarded as threatened by national and international conservation assessment systems. In order to preserve amphibian diversity in the study area it is vital to protect the last remnants of native vegetation, especially mountain cloud forest, but also including Shade coffee, since the latter habitat harbors amphibian diversity similar to that found in native forests. Finally, implementation of policies that both reduce Grazing areas and increase their productivity is also necessary, since these highly modified areas turn out to be the ones that affect amphibian diversity the most.},

   abstract = {Recent global assessments have shown the limited coverage of protected areas across tropical biotas, fuelling a growing interest in the potential conservation services provided by anthropogenic landscapes. Here we examine the geographic distribution of biological diversity in the Atlantic Forest of South America, synthesize the most conspicuous forest biodiversity responses to human disturbances, propose further conservation initiatives for this biota, and offer a range of general insights into the prospects of forest species persistence in human-modified tropical forest landscapes worldwide. At the biome scale, the most extensive pre-Columbian habitats across the Atlantic Forest ranged across elevations below 800. masl, which still concentrate most areas within the major centers of species endemism. Unfortunately, up to 88% of the original forest habitat has been lost, mainly across these low to intermediate elevations, whereas protected areas are clearly skewed towards high elevations above 1200. masl. At the landscape scale, most remaining Atlantic Forest cover is embedded within dynamic agro-mosaics including elements such as small forest fragments, early-to-late secondary forest patches and exotic tree monocultures. In this sort of aging or long-term modified landscapes, habitat fragmentation appears to effectively drive edge-dominated portions of forest fragments towards an early-successional system, greatly limiting the long-term persistence of forest-obligate and forest-dependent species. However, the extent to which forest habitats approach early-successional systems, thereby threatening the bulk of the Atlantic Forest biodiversity, depends on both past and present landscape configuration. Many elements of human-modified landscapes (e.g. patches of early-secondary forests and tree monocultures) may offer excellent conservation opportunities, but they cannot replace the conservation value of protected areas and hitherto unprotected large patches of old-growth forests. Finally, the biodiversity conservation services provided by anthropogenic landscapes across Atlantic Forest and other tropical forest regions can be significantly augmented by coupling biodiversity corridor initiatives with biota-scale attempts to plug existing gaps in the representativeness of protected areas. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {There is substantial evidence that environmental changes on a landscape level can have dramatic consequences for the species richness and structure of food webs as well as on trophic interactions within such food webs. Thus far, the consequences of environmental change, and particularly the effects of invasive species and the fragmentation and isolation of natural habitats, have most often been studied in a purely ecological context, with the main emphasis on the description of alterations in species abundance and diversity and trophic links within food webs. Here, we argue that the study of evolutionary processes that may be affected by such changes is urgently needed to enhance our understanding of the consequences of environmental change. This requires an approach that treats species as dynamic systems with plastic responses to change rather than as static entities. As such, phenotypic plasticity on an individual level and genotypic change as a population level response should be taken into account when studying the consequences of a changing world. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we report on recent advances in our understanding, identify some major gaps in our current knowledge, and point towards rewarding approaches to enhance our understanding of how environmental change alters trophic interactions and ecosystems. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

   abstract = {The bird fauna of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest is exceptionally diverse and threatened, with high levels of endemism. Available lists of the endemic birds of the Atlantic Forest were generated before recent taxonomic revisions lumped or split species and before the recent increase in species occurrence records. Our objective, therefore, was to compile a new list of the endemic birds of the Atlantic Forest, characterize these species in terms of conservation status and natural history traits, and map remaining vegetation and protected areas. We combined GIS analysis with a literature search to compile a list of endemic species and, based on the phylogeny and distribution of these species, characterized areas in terms of species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and endemism. We identified 223 species of birds endemic to the Atlantic Forest, including 12 species not included in previous lists. In addition, 14 species included in previous lists were not considered endemic, either because they occur outside the Atlantic Forest biome or because they are not considered valid species. The typical Atlantic Forest endemic bird is a small forest-dependent invertivore. Of the species on our list, 31% are considered threatened or extinct. Only ~ 34% of the spatial analysis units had > 10% forest cover, and protected area coverage was consistently low (< 1%). In addition, we found spatial incongruity among the different measures of biodiversity (species richness, relative phylogenetic diversity, restricted-range species, and irreplaceability). Each of these measures provides information concerning different aspects of biological diversity. However, regardless of which aspect(s) of biodiversity might be considered most important, preservation of the remaining areas of remnant vegetation and further expansion of protected areas are essential if we are to conserve the many endemic species of birds in the Atlantic Forest.},

Yet we generally lack an understanding of how morphological traits respond to water level decrease under natural conditions. Here, we studied variation in body size and shape in lateral view in tadpoles of Scinax squalirostris and Odontophrynus americanus inhabiting ponds in superhumid highland plateau in southern Brazil. Hydroperiod did not affect tadpole size in either species. In relation to body shape, S. squalirostris tadpoles from long hydroperiod ponds had shorter tails and deeper tail fins than tadpoles from other hydroperiods. Predator presence was positively associated with hydroperiod, restricting our ability to separate their effects on tadpoles morphology. For O. americanus, tadpole shape was not affected by pond hydroperiod. We demonstrated that, in natural environment, the influence of hydroperiod on tadpole morphology might depend on species-specific characteristics, such as behavior and life-history traits. Our results indicate that local context may lead to different effects of hydroperiod, and hydroperiod alone can only partly explain the variation on tadpole shape.},

Larval anuran amphibians (tadpoles) are classified into distinct ecomorphological guilds based upon morphological features and observations of their ecology. The extent to which guilds comprise distinct morphologies resulting from convergent evolution, the degree of morphological variability within each guild, and the degree of continuity in shape between guilds has not previously been examined in a phylogenetically informed statistical framework. Here, we examine tadpole ecomorphological guilds at a macroevolutionary scale by examining morphological diversity across the Australian continent. We use ecological data to classify species to guilds, and geometric morphometrics to quantify body shape in the tadpoles of 188 species, 77% of Australian frog diversity. We find that the ecomorphological guilds represented by Australian species are morphologically distinct, but there is substantial morphological variation associated with each guild, and all guilds together form a morphological continuum. However, in a phylogenetic comparative context, there is no significant difference in body shape among guilds. We also relate the morphological diversity of the Australian assemblage of tadpoles to a global sample and demonstrate that ecomorphological diversity of Australian tadpoles is limited with respect to worldwide species. Our results demonstrate that general patterns of ecomorphological variation are upheld in Australian tadpoles, but tadpole body shape is more variable and possibly generalist than generally appreciated.},

   abstract = {We present data on amphibian density, species richness, and diversity from a 7140-ha area consisting of 200 ponds in the Midwestern U.S. that represents most of the possible lentic aquatic breeding habitats common in this region. Our study includes all possible breeding sites with natural and anthropogenic disturbance processes that can be missing from studies where sampling intensity is low, sample area is small, or partial disturbance gradients are sampled. We tested whether pond area was a significant predictor of density, species richness, and diversity of amphibians and if values peaked at intermediate pond areas. We found that in all cases a quadratic model fit our data significantly better than a linear model. Because small ponds have a high probability of pond drying and large ponds have a high probability of fish colonization and accumulation of invertebrate predators, drying and predation may be two mechanisms driving the peak of density and diversity towards intermediate values of pond size. We also found that not all intermediate sized ponds produced many larvae; in fact, some had low amphibian density, richness, and diversity. Further analyses of the subset of ponds represented in the peak of the area distribution showed that fish, hydroperiod, invertebrate density, and canopy are additional factors that drive density, richness and diversity of ponds up or down, when extremely small or large ponds are eliminated. Our results indicate that fishless ponds at intermediate sizes are more diverse, produce more larvae, and have greater potential to recruit juveniles into adult populations of most species sampled. Further, hylid and chorus frogs are found predictably more often in ephemeral ponds whereas bullfrogs, green frogs, and cricket frogs are found most often in permanent ponds with fish. Our data increase understanding of what factors structure and maintain amphibian diversity across large landscapes.},

Eight species (Xenopus victorianus, Amietophrynus regularis, Ptychadena anchietae, P. poroshsima, Kassina senegalensis, Afrixalus quadrivittatus, Hyperolius kivuensis, H. lateralis) were taxonomically identified. The remaining seven species (three species of Hyperolius, two Phrynobatrachus, one Amietia, one Ptychadena) represent undescribed or currently unrecognized taxa, suggesting a significant magnitude of overlooked amphibian diversity in Afromontane communities. Acoustic niche analysis of the 14 species producing airborne advertisement calls integrated the spatial dimension, i.e. the microhabitat used for calling, the temporal dimension, i.e. the time of day when calling takes place, and the call structure dimension, i.e. the physical features of the advertisement call. Average standardized acoustic niche breadth was narrow (measured: 0.08, predicted: 0.07) and showed low variability (0.040.16) among species, which means that empirical data are in full agreement with the predictions of stochastic niche theory for species-saturated communities. Niche segregation was mainly based on advertisement call features, whereas spatial and temporal niche dimension contributed less. Measured average niche overlap (0.30) was intermediate between random overlap (0.51) and minimum possible overlap (0.11), indicating significant acoustic resource partitioning. The only taxon group with widely overlapping acoustic niches were Ptychadena spp., which might indicate a recent invasion of the community by one or two of the three species.},

Between 2018 and 2020, 13 ponds associated to roads with medium-low (RP-30) and high levels of vehicular traffic (NR-A005) were sampled. For each site were surveyed variables of pond and surrounding habitat and records of ambient noise, characterized spectrally and temporally. The presence of anuran species and their relative abundance were measured. Significant differences were found between roads in all noise variables, being greater in the RN-A005, except for the average entropy that was higher for the RP-30. The specific richness and the average relative abundance were higher in the RP30 sites, which generally presented significantly lower noise levels; lower urbanization, more vegetated roadsides; greater distances and steep slopes from the roadway, reducing the spread of noise; presence, mainly, of rural environments on both roadsides contributing low additional levels of anthropic noise. Our results show that the structure of the noise profile and the degree to which noise is spread and perceived in the reproductive sites of anurans, depends on a set of variables specific to each habitat that should be considered when conducting studies that evaluate the responses of individuals to this type of contamination.},

According to the latitudinal gradient hypothesis (LGH), this pattern was shaped by differential effects of Late Quaternary climatic changes across a latitudinal gradient. Here, we evaluate the effects of climatic changes across a tropical latitudinal gradient and its implications to diversification of an Atlantic Forest (AF) endemic passerine. We studied the intraspecific diversification and historical demography of Sclerurus scansor, based on mitochondrial (ND2, ND3 and cytb) and nuclear (FIB7) gene sequences. Phylogenetic analyses recovered three well-supported clades associated with distinct latitudinal zones. Coalescent-based methods were applied to estimate divergence times and changes in effective population sizes. Estimates of divergence times indicate that intraspecific diversification took place during Middle-Late Pleistocene. Distinct demographic scenarios were identified, with the southern lineage exhibiting a clear signature of demographic expansion, while the central one remained more stable. The northern lineage, contrasting with LGH predictions, exhibited a clear sign of a recent bottleneck. Our results suggest that different AF regions reacted distinctly, even in opposite ways, under the same climatic period, producing simultaneously favourable scenarios for isolation and contact among populations. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

We compared methods that measure the gap fraction at a single zenith angle (0° or 57°), with fisheye photography that measures the gap fraction at multiple zenith angles. We applied these methods in an unthinned stand of the broadleaf tree species Eucalyptus marginata that had an initial L of 3. We removed one-third of the trees and reapplied the methods, and then removed another one-third of the trees and applied the methods a third time. L from the photographic methods was compared to L obtained from destructive sampling and allometry. We found that L was accurately estimated from non-fisheye images taken at the zenith, providing that the total gap fraction was divided into large, between-crown gaps and smaller, within-crown gaps, prior to using the Beer-Lambert law to estimate L. This rapid and simple method corrected for foliage clumping and provided estimates of crown porosity, crown cover, foliage cover and the foliage clumping index at the zenith, but required an assumption about the light extinction coefficient at the zenith. Fisheye photography also provided good estimates of L but only if the images were corrected for the gamma function of the digital camera, and the combined Chen-Cihlar and Lang-Xiang method of correcting for foliage clumping was used. The clumping index derived from fisheye images was insensitive to thinning but the calculated foliage projection coefficient was. Methods of obtaining and analysing gap fraction and gap size distributions from fisheye photography need further improvement to separate the effects of foliage clumping and leaf angle distribution. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The study was required by decision-makers as part of the research of the project “Strengthening National Frameworks for Invasive Alien Species Governance” funded by GEF (Global Environmental Facility). The impacts of beaver (Castor canadensis), rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), American mink (Neovison vison), yellow jacket (Vespula germanica), blackberry (Rubus spp.), and ulex (Ulex europaeus) were assessed. Few impacts could be estimated given the lack of information in Chile. Considering the impacts assessed, Chile may lose at least USD 90 million per year due to these seven IAS. Without implementing control measures, in 20 years, Chile will lose at least approximately USD 2 billion from the impacts of these species on biodiversity and productive sectors.},

   abstract = {The potential impact of domestic cats on wildlife is the subject of growing international interest and concern. While feral cats are often the primary focus of research and debate, in many societies a substantial proportion of domestic cats are owned by private individuals. We present a typology that classifies domestic cats in relation to varying degrees of human control over their reproduction, movement, and provisioning. Understanding the perceptions and practices of cat owners will be key to identifying and mitigating any negative ecological effects of cat hunting behaviour. To investigate how cat owners perceive (a) their pets’ hunting behaviour, (b) their responsibilities for managing this, and (c) the mitigation strategies available, we conducted detailed interviews with a diverse sample of cat owners in the United Kingdom. We identified a spectrum of views on hunting behaviour, from owners who perceived hunting as positive (for pest control, or as healthy cat behaviour) to those who were deeply concerned about its consequences for wild animals, their populations, and welfare. However, hunting was widely understood as a normal, natural component of cat behaviour, and owners rarely perceived a strong individual responsibility for preventing or reducing it. Those who did wish to manage hunting perceived several barriers to this, including concern that they were unable to control behaviour effectively without compromising cat welfare, doubt about the efficacy and practicality of popular mitigation measures, and unfamiliarity with alternative options. We recommend that (a) initiatives directed at changing cat owners’ behaviour consider the multiple factors and competing priorities that inform their decision-making (particularly cat health and welfare and practicality or cost of interventions); (b) researchers work collaboratively with cat owners and veterinary, cat welfare, and conservation organizations to identify effective solutions, and (c) some degree of accountability for managing problematic hunting behaviour should be promoted as a part of “responsible pet ownership” initiatives.

   abstract = {native plants, and the federally threatened desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) (Brooks and Esque 2002). Thus, plant invasions that alter fire regimes can have repercussions that ripple throughout ecosystems, and these multiple effects may complicate the task of restoring ecosystems to preinvasion conditions. Some of the effects of plant invasions on fire regimes have been previously described (e.g., D'Antonio and Vi-tousek 1992, Mack and D'Antonio 1998, D'Antonio 2000), but these examples largely focus on one well-known type of change, namely, grass invasions that increase fuel-bed flam-mability, and on the positive feedback cycle that can develop between invasive grasses and the frequency, size, spatial pattern, and, in some cases, intensity of fires. There are other important ways in which plant invaders can affect fuels and fire regimes, but these have not been documented as thoroughly, either because they have not yet been studied or because they are less common. In this article, we describe the full range of pathways through which plant invaders can change fuel properties and, in doing so, alter fire regimes. It is not our purpose to conduct a thorough review of this topic. Rather, we present a general conceptual model of the invasive plant-fire regime cycle that summarizes the various possible interrelationships between invasive plants, fuels, and fire regimes, including indirect links through native plants and other ecosystem properties. We also present a system designed to help managers determine what can be done at various phases of the in-vasive plant-fire regime cycle to prevent further changes and reverse the changes that have already occurred. Fire is a type of disturbance (sensu Sousa 1984), and ecosystems are partly defined on the basis of disturbance regimes of specific frequency, intensity, extent, type, and seasonality (sensu Pickett and White 1985) (figure 1). Fire frequency may be defined as a measure of the fire cycle (average time for fire to burn an area equal in size to the given area of interest) or of the fire return interval (average time before fire re-burns a given area, also called the fire recurrence interval). We use the latter definition in this article. Fire intensity, the amount of heat released per unit of time, is related to fire severity , which is the effect of this heat release on biotic and abi-otic ecosystem properties. Fire extent includes both the size and the spatial homogeneity of burning. Fires have traditionally been classified according to fire type, which includes the categories of ground fire (e.g., peat-bog fires), surface fire (e.g., grass fires), and crown fire (e.g., forest-canopy fires). Sea-sonality refers to the annual window of fire activity and is largely determined by the ability of fuels to ignite and carry fire. Disturbance regimes affect ecosystem properties such as the rates of soil erosion or formation and the pathways and temporal patterns of nutrient cycling and energy flow. Disturbance regimes can also act as a selective force affecting the life-history traits of individual species and the composition, structure, and emergent properties of entire groups of organisms. Over evolutionary time, fire regimes can promote coexistence of plant species, with different life forms dominating at different stages of postfire succession (Cowling 1987). Fire regimes are affected by spatial and temporal variations in topography, climate, and fuel (figure 1). Although topography changes over geologic time, regional climate can potentially shift within the scale of centuries to decades, and fuel conditions can change within a day following a major disturbance. Rapid fuel changes can also rapidly change micro-climates within vegetation stands. Fuels are the one ecosystem component that is inextricably linked with fire regime by feedback loops through other ecosystem properties and plants (figure 1). Shifts outside the natural range of fuel conditions can result in directional shifts in fire behavior and fire regime},

Although variation in the form and function of the pelvic girdle and associated appendicular system related to specialized locomotor modes such as swimming or burrowing has been documented, the forelimbs have typically been viewed as relatively unspecialized. Yet, previous authors have noted versatility in forelimb function among arboreal frogs associated with feeding. Here we study the morphology and function of the forelimb and hand during locomotion in two species of arboreal frogs (Litoria caerulea and Phyllomedusa bicolor). Our data show a complex arrangement of the distal forelimb and hand musculature with some notable differences between species. Analyses of high-speed video and video fluoroscopy recordings show that forelimbs are used in alternating fashion in a diagonal sequence footfall pattern and that the position of the hand is adjusted when walking on substrates of different diameters. Electromyographic recordings show that the flexors of the hand are active during substrate contact, suggesting the use of gripping to generate a stabilizing torque. Measurements of grasping forces in vivo and during stimulation experiments show that both species, are capable of executing a so-called power grip but also indicates marked differences between species, in the magnitude of forces generated. Stimulation experiments showed an increased control of digit flexion in the more specialized of the two species, allowing it to execute a precision grip paralleled only by that seen in primates. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland.},

   abstract = {We conducted a literature review on the current status of all known extralimital populations of the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, to identify commonality in invasion pathways, lag between discovery and introduction, and whether old populations are in decline. Further, we investigated which locations are vulnerable to future establishment using geospatial data (1,075 native and 124 invasive records) in a Maxent model developed with data from the Worldclim database. We found introductions of X. laevis to be continuous over the last 50 years and invasions to be ongoing on four continents: Asia, Europe, North and South America. Invasion pathways were related to scientific use and the pet trade, with high rates of deliberate release followed by a lag of 2-25 years to first reports. No populations were found to be declining although some have been extirpated. Optimal uninvaded bioclimatic space was identified in central Mexico and southern Australia, while larger suitable areas were found in southern South America and southwestern Europe. Xenopus laevis is a cryptic invasive species that is likely to increase its invasive distribution, through new introductions and by the spread of ongoing invasions. Many more invasive populations are likely to exist than are currently recognised and reducing invasive potential will largely rely on education of those involved with their captive care. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

   abstract = {Amphibian skin is rich in mucous glands and poison glands, secreting substances important for gas exchange and playing a fundamental role in chemical defense against predators and microorganisms. In the caecilian Siphonops annulatus (Mikan, 1920) we observed a concentration of enlarged mucous glands in the head region. In the posterior region of the body a similar concentration is made up of enlarged poison glands. These accumulations of glands structurally resemble the macroglands previously reported in anurans and salamanders. The skin glands in these regions are each surrounded by collagen walls forming a honeycomb-like structure. The collagen network in the head region firmly attaches to tiny pits in the bones of the skull. The two extremities of the body produce different secretions, containing exclusive molecules. Considering the fossorial lifestyle of caecilians, it seems evident that the secretions of the head and caudal region serve different functions. The anterior macrogland of mucous glands, rich in mucous/lipid secretion, in conjunction with the funnel-shaped head, may act to lubricate the body and penetrate the soil, thus facilitating locomotion underground. The blunt posterior end bearing an internalized macrogland of poison glands in the dermis may act in chemical defense and/or by blocking invasion of tunnels.},

   abstract = {Vocalizations of anuran amphibians have received much attention in studies of behavioral ecology and physiology, but also provide informative characters for identifying and delimiting species. We here review the terminology and variation of frog calls from a perspective of integrative taxonomy, and provide hands-on protocols for recording, analyzing, comparing, interpreting and describing these sounds. Our focus is on advertisement calls, which serve as premating isolation mechanisms and, therefore, convey important taxonomic information. We provide recommendations for terminology of frog vocalizations, with call, note and pulse being the fundamental subunits to be used in descriptions and comparisons. However, due to the complexity and diversity of these signals, an unequivocal application of the terms call and note can be challenging. We therefore provide two coherent concepts that either follow a note-centered approach (defining uninterrupted units of sound as notes, and their entirety as call) or a call-centered approach (defining uninterrupted units as call whenever they are separated by long silent intervals) in terminology. Based on surveys of literature, we show that numerous call traits can be highly variable within and between individuals of one species. Despite idiosyncrasies of species and higher taxa, the duration of calls or notes, pulse rate within notes, and number of pulses per note appear to be more static within individuals and somewhat less affected by temperature. Therefore, these variables might often be preferable as taxonomic characters over call rate or note rate, which are heavily influenced by various factors. Dominant frequency is also comparatively static and only weakly affected by temperature, but depends strongly on body size. As with other taxonomic characters, strong call divergence is typically indicative of species-level differences, whereas call similarities of two populations are no evidence for them being conspecific. Taxonomic conclusions can especially be drawn when the general advertisement call structure of two candidate species is radically different and qualitative call differences are thus observed. On the other hand, quantitative differences in call traits might substantially vary within and among conspecific populations, and require careful evaluation and analysis. We provide guidelines for the taxonomic interpretation of advertisement call differences in sympatric and allopatric situations, and emphasize the need for an integrative use of multiple datasets (bio-acoustics, morphology, genetics), particularly for allopatric scenarios. We show that small-sized frogs often emit calls with frequency components in the ultrasound spectrum, although it is unlikely that these high frequencies are of biological relevance for the majority of them, and we illustrate that detection of upper harmonics depends also on recording distance because higher frequencies are attenuated more strongly. Bioacoustics remains a prime approach in integrative taxonomy of anurans if uncertainty due to possible intraspecific variation and technical artifacts is adequately considered and acknowledged.},

   abstract = {1. In recent years the use of species distribution models by ecologists and conservation managers has increased considerably, along with an awareness of the need to provide accuracy assessment for predictions of such models. The kappa statistic is the most widely used measure for the performance of models generating presence-absence predictions, but several studies have criticized it for being inherently dependent on prevalence, and argued that this dependency introduces statistical artefacts to estimates of predictive accuracy. This criticism has been supported recently by computer simulations showing that kappa responds to the prevalence of the modelled species in a unimodal fashion. 2. In this paper we provide a theoretical explanation for the observed dependence of kappa on prevalence, and introduce into ecology an alternative measure of accuracy, the true skill statistic (TSS), which corrects for this dependence while still keeping all the advantages of kappa. We also compare the responses of kappa and TSS to prevalence using empirical data, by modelling distribution patterns of 128 species of woody plant in Israel. 3. The theoretical analysis shows that kappa responds in a unimodal fashion to variation in prevalence and that the level of prevalence that maximizes kappa depends on the ratio between sensitivity (the proportion of correctly predicted presences) and specificity (the proportion of correctly predicted absences). In contrast, TSS is independent of prevalence. 4. When the two measures of accuracy were compared using empirical data, kappa showed a unimodal response to prevalence, in agreement with the theoretical analysis. TSS showed a decreasing linear response to prevalence, a result we interpret as reflecting true ecological phenomena rather than a statistical artefact. This interpretation is supported by the fact that a similar pattern was found for the area under the ROC curve, a measure known to be independent of prevalence. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide theoretical and empirical evidence that kappa, one of the most widely used measures of model performance in ecology, has serious limitations that make it unsuitable for such applications. The alternative we suggest, TSS, compensates for the shortcomings of kappa while keeping all of its advantages. We therefore recommend the TSS as a simple and intuitive measure for the performance of species distribution models when predictions are expressed as presence-absence maps. © 2006 The Authors.},

Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress.

   abstract = {1. Models for predicting the distribution of organisms from environmental data are widespread in ecology and conservation biology. Their performance is invariably evaluated from the percentage success at predicting occurrence at test locations. 2. Using logistic regression with real data from 34 families of aquatic invertebrates in 180 Himalayan streams, we illustrate how this widespread measure of predictive accuracy is affected systematically by the prevalence (i.e. the frequency of occurrence) of the target organism. Many evaluations of presence-absence models by ecologists are inherently misleading. 3. With the same invertebrate models, we examined alternative performance measures used in remote sensing and medical diagnostics. We particularly explored receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) plots, from which were derived (i) the area under each curve (AUC), considered an effective indicator of model performance independent of the threshold probability at which the presence of the target organism is accepted, and (ii) optimized probability thresholds that maximize the percentage of true absences and presences that are correctly identified. We also evaluated Cohen's kappa, a measure of the proportion of all possible cases of presence or absence that are predicted correctly after accounting for chance effects. 4. AUC measures from ROC plots were independent of prevalence, but highly significantly correlated with the much more easily computed kappa. Moreover, when applied in predictive mode to test data, models with thresholds optimized by ROC erroneously overestimated true occurrence among scarcer organisms, often those of greatest conservation interest. We advocate caution in using ROC methods to optimize thresholds required for real prediction. 5. Our strongest recommendation is that ecologists reduce their reliance on prediction success as a performance measure in presence-absence modelling. Cohen's kappa provides a simple, effective, standardized and appropriate statistic for evaluating or comparing presence-absence models, even those based on different statistical algorithms. None of the performance measures we examined tests the statistical significance of predictive accuracy, and we identify this as a priority area for research and development.},

   abstract = {Species abundance distributions (SADs) follow one of ecology's oldest and most universal laws - every community shows a hollow curve or hyperbolic shape on a histogram with many rare species and just a few common species. Here, we review theoretical, empirical and statistical developments in the study of SADs. Several key points emerge. (i) Literally dozens of models have been proposed to explain the hollow curve. Unfortunately, very few models are ever rejected, primarily because few theories make any predictions beyond the hollow-curve SAD itself. (ii) Interesting work has been performed both empirically and theoretically, which goes beyond the hollow-curve prediction to provide a rich variety of information about how SADs behave. These include the study of SADs along environmental gradients and theories that integrate SADs with other biodiversity patterns. Central to this body of work is an effort to move beyond treating the SAD in isolation and to integrate the SAD into its ecological context to enable making many predictions. (iii) Moving forward will entail understanding how sampling and scale affect SADs and developing statistical tools for describing and comparing SADs. We are optimistic that SADs can provide significant insights into basic and applied ecological science. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

   abstract = {Aim Beta diversity can be partitioned into two components: dissimilarity due to species replacement and dissimilarity due to nestedness (Baselga, 2010, Global Ecology and Biogeography, 19, 134-143). Several contributions have challenged this approach or proposed alternative frameworks. Here, I review the concepts and methods used in these recent contributions, with the aim of clarifying: (1) the rationale behind the partitioning of beta diversity into species replacement and nestedness-resultant dissimilarity, (2) how, based on this rationale, numerators and denominators of indices have to match, and (3) how nestedness and nestedness-resultant dissimilarity are related but different concepts. Innovation The rationale behind measures of species replacement (turnover) dictates that the number of species that are replaced between sites (numerator of the index) has to be relativized with respect to the total number of species that could potentially be replaced (denominator). However, a recently proposed partition of Jaccard dissimilarity fails to do this. In consequence, this partition underestimates the contribution of species replacement and overestimates the contribution of richness differences to total dissimilarity. I show how Jaccard dissimilarity can be partitioned into meaningful turnover and nestedness components, and extend these new indices to multiple-site situations. Finally the concepts of nestedness and nestedness-resultant dissimilarity are discussed. Main conclusions Nestedness should be assessed using consistent measures that depend both on paired overlap and matrix filling, e.g. NODF, whereas beta-diversity patterns should be examined using measures that allow the total dissimilarity to be separated into the components of dissimilarity due to species replacement and dissimilarity due to nestedness. In the case of multiple-site dissimilarity patterns, averaged pairwise indices should never be used because the mean of the pairwise values is unable to accurately reflect the multiple-site attributes of dissimilarity. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {The SLOSS debate - whether a single large reserve will conserve more species than several small - of the 1970s and 1980s never came to a resolution. The first rule of reserve design states that one large reserve will conserve the most species, a rule which has been heavily contested. Empirical data seem to undermine the reliance on general rules, indicating that the best strategy varies from case to case. Modeling has also been deployed in this debate. We may divide the modeling approaches to the SLOSS enigma into dynamic and static approaches. Dynamic approaches, covered by the fields of island equilibrium theory of island biogeography and metapopulation theory, look at immigration, emigration, and extinction. Static approaches, such as the one in this paper, illustrate how several factors affect the number of reserves that will save the most species.This article approaches the effect of different factors by the application of species-diversity models. These models combine species-area curves for two or more reserves, correcting for the species overlap between them. Such models generate several predictions on how different factors affect the optimal number of reserves. The main predictions are: Fewer and larger reserves are favored by increased species overlap between reserves, by faster growth in number of species with reserve area increase, by higher minimum-area requirements, by spatial aggregation and by uneven species abundances. The effect of increased distance between smaller reserves depends on the two counteracting factors: decreased species density caused by isolation (which enhances minimum-area effect) and decreased overlap between isolates. The first decreases the optimal number of reserves; the second increases the optimal number. The effect of total reserve-system area depends both on the shape of the species-area curve and on whether overlap between reserves changes with scale.The approach to modeling presented here has several implications for conservational strategies. It illustrates well how the SLOSS enigma can be reduced to a question of the shape of the species-area curve that is expected or generated from reserves of different sizes and a question of overlap between isolates (or reserves). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Most efforts aimed at elucidating the factors responsible for the variation in species richness among different parasite communities have focused on host characteristics such as body mass or diet. Independently of host features, however, the way in which parasites use resources within the host may also affect the species richness of the community. The distribution of parasite individuals or biomass in niche space determines whether host resources are used evenly, or whether there are gaps in resource use, with some parts of the total niche being underutilized. Here, the concepts of functional richness and functional evenness are applied to parasite communities for the first time, using simple indices. Measurements of the distribution of species in niche space within communities, such as mapping the distribution of hel-minths along the length of the host's intestine, is standard practice in parasitology. In such cases, functional richness is simply the proportion of the total number of intestine sections available that are used by at least 1 worm, whereas functional evenness measures the evenness in the distribution of worm numbers or biomass across all niche sections that are occupied. Data on cestode communities of elasmobranchs are used to illustrate the use of these indices, and to show how important they can be in tests of ecological hypotheses. The indices presented here capture essential features of resource use in parasite communities, and can be useful tools for comparative analyses.},

   abstract = {We created a new dataset of spatially interpolated monthly climate data for global land areas at a very high spatial resolution (approximately 1 km2). We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

The data were obtained in eight sampling units with dimensions of 20m x 50m, distributed in a systematic way, totaling 0.8 ha sample; grouped in fve models of SADs (broken-stick, niche-preemption, lognormal, Zipf and Zipf-Mandelbrot) for the sample of the tree community and the eight sampling units; the criteria of accuracy of the models were: Akaike, Bayesian and Deviance. The ecological model described the SADs that rank/abundance of tree species for ecological community which was the Zipf-Mandelbrot.

The Zipf-Mandelbrot model postulates the colonization of species under the requirements of environmental preconditions for the establishment of the species, and thus detects up an arboreal community stage of maturity. The ecological models of SADs obtained for the sampling units, separately, show the disparity in the distribution of species abundance within the tree community that was interpreted as the effect of heterogeneity of conditions and environmental resources, and natural disturbances, originating a mosaic vegetation.},

This paper will review how the spatial structure of biological populations and communities can be studied. We first demonstrate that many of the basic statistical methods used in ecological studies are impaired by autocorrelated data. Most if not all environmental data fall in this category. We will look briefly at ways of performing valid statistical tests in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Methods now available for analysing the spatial structure of biological populations are described, and illustrated by vegetation data. These include various methods to test for the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the data: univariate methods (all-directional and two-dimensional spatial correlograms, and two-dimensional spectral analysis), and the multivariate Mantel test and Mantel correlogram; other descriptive methods of spatial structure: the univariate variogram, and the multivariate methods of clustering with spatial contiguity constraint; the partial Mantel test, presented here as a way of studying causal models that include space as an explanatory variable; and finally, various methods for mapping ecological variables and producing either univariate maps (interpolation, trend surface analysis, kriging) or maps of truly multivariate data (produced by constrained clustering).

   abstract = {Aim Current weaknesses of diversity theory include: a failure to distinguish different biogeographical response variables under the general heading of diversity; and a general failure of ecological theory to deal adequately with geographical scale. Our aim is to articulate the case for a top-down approach to theory building, in which scale is addressed explicitly and in which different response variables are clearly distinguished. Location The article draws upon both theoretical contributions and empirical analyses from all latitudes, focusing on terrestrial ecosystems and with some bias towards (woody) plants. Methods We review current diversity theory and terminology in relation to scale of applicability. As a starting point in developing a general theory, we take the issue of geographical gradients in species richness as a main theme and evaluate the extent to which commonly cited theories are likely to operate at scales from the macro down to the local. Results A degree of confusion surrounds the use of the terms alpha, beta and gamma diversity, and the terms local, landscape and macro-scale are preferred here as a more intuitive framework. The distinction between inventory and differentiation diversity is highlighted as important as, in terms of scale of analysis, are the concepts of focus and extent. The importance of holding area constant in analysis is stressed, as is the notion that different environmental factors exhibit measurable heterogeneity at different scales. Evaluation of several of the most common diversity theories put forward for the grand clines in species richness, indicates that they can be collapsed to dynamic hypotheses based on climate or historical explanations. The importance of the many ecological/ biological mechanisms that have been proposed is evident mainly at local scales of analysis, whilst at the macro-scale they are dependent largely upon climatic controls for their operation. Local communities have often been found not to be saturated, i.e. to be non-equilibrial. This is argued, perhaps counter-intuitively, to be entirely compatible with the persistence through time of macro-scale patterns of richness that are climatically determined. The review also incorporates recent developments in macroecology, Rapoport's rule, trade-offs, and the importance of isolation, landscape impedance and geometric constraints on richness (the mid-domain effect) in generating richness patterns; highlighting those phenomena that are contributory to the ®rst-order climatic pattern, and those, such as the geometric constraints, that may confound or obscure these patterns. Main conclusions A general theory of diversity must necessarily cover many disparate phenomena, at various scales of analysis, and cannot therefore be expressed in a simple formula, but individual elements of this general theory may be. In particular, it appears possible to capture in a dynamic climate-based model and`capacityand`capacity rule', the form of the},

   abstract = {One approach to the study of the structure of animal communities for which there is a considerable amount of raw data is the comparison of abundances of the species of a group of organisms in a given locality. The basic information is a list of species found and the abundance of each. This can best be plotted by ranking the species from commonest to rarest along the abscissa and plotting their abundances along the ordinate. For convenience, the abscissa is graduated logarithmically. Earlier investigations,' discussed elsewhere,2 fit known statistical curves of uncertain biological meaning to the data. A more fruitful approach seems to be to predict curves on the basis of simple biological hypotheses and to compare these with the data. Three such hypotheses will be discussed here. First, however, the evidence cited by Lack,3 combined with the observation that censuses yield similar results when taken in the same habitat either at the same time in different places or in the same place in different years, indicates, for birds at least, that the observed populations are not under the control of very local or rapid temporal processes; i.e., they are in a near-equilibrium state. The hypotheses will therefore be ones which yield an equilibrium or near-equilibrium population. Hypothesis 1: Nonoverlapping Niches. The environment is compared with a stick of unit length on which n-1 points are thrown at random. The stick is broken at these points, and the lengths of the n resulting segments are proportional to the abundances of the n species. This comparison is legitimate, since the mathematical part of the derivation can be used unchanged for spaces of higher dimension. The most complete discussion of the resulting distribution is given by Barton and David.4 The expected length of the rth shortest interval is given by (1/n) Z [1/(n-i + 1) ], so that the expected abundance of the rth rarest species r among n species and m individuals is (m/n) Z [1/(n-i + 1)]. This is plotted in Figure 1. Bird censuses from tropical forests5 and many temperate regions fit this hypothesis almost perfectly. Quite frequently, however, the resulting curve is too steep; i.e., common species are too abundant, rare species too rare. These steep curves can be duplicated by considering the community as composed of two sticks of very different lengths (totaling unit length), each broken randomly into n/2 pieces. This is easily generalized to communities which are composed of several smaller ones, each obeying the original hypothesis. These composite communities are heterogeneous. The divergence from the ideal curve may, in fact, be regarded on this hypothesis as a measure of heterogeneity. Experimentally , for bird communities, this appears to explain most of the "steep" curves. For example, the census of Quaker Run Valley in Pennsylvania6 yields a curve which is much too steep. When the censuses of the small pieces of the valley are plotted separately, they are in good agreement with the hypothesis. Some other populations of species, as of trees, do not seem to have this composite property and may require a different explanation.},

Our results support the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, with both highly mobile and relatively sedentary taxa conforming to the predicted bell-shaped curve. Taxon richness was not related to habitat area (stream width), distance from the headwater, or the diversity of microhabitats (particle size categories) but was significantly and negatively related to the proportion of the substratum made up of small particles. Of all the factors measured, however, bed disturbance was by far the best at accounting for variation in taxonomic richness. We also quantified several kinds of potential refugia for invertebrates and found a positive relationship between richness and a refugia axis that combines amount of dead space with proportion of large substratum particles.},

It occurs in different ecosystems and uses varied shelters, from caves and crevices to human constructions, such as roofs and ceilings. Despite its wide distribution, there are several sampling gaps that make it difficult to identify the regions where the species occurs. This is a particular problem for the sub-species T. brasiliensis brasiliensis in South America, a region with few studies in comparison to North America. Considering these problems involved with identifying the distribution of T. b. brasiliensis in South America, we inferred its distribution based on 121 confirmed occurrences for the subspecies. We created a species distribution model (SDM) using the ensemble approach from the combination of BIOCLIM, SVM, GLM and MaxEnt algorithms. The resulting model suggested that the subspecies is unlikely to occur in the Amazon region and has a positive affinity with human population density, topography, a lower vegetation index, and the precipitation in the driest month. Our results show there is a large continuous area suitable for T. b. brasiliensis in central and eastern South America, with interruptions and narrow areas toward Central America. The population in this last area is separated from a smaller site in Chile by Andean deserts, snowy peaks, and high-altitude points. Our results demonstrated that along its distribution suitable habitat for T. b. brasiliensis is not continuous. The discontinuities in populations require further investigation to determine if there are phylogeographic consequences for the species.},

Once the modeling goal is clearly articulated, an appropriate model selection procedure is easier to identify. We review model selection approaches and highlight their strengths and weaknesses relative to each of the three modeling goals. We then present examples of modeling for exploration, inference, and prediction using a time series of butterfly population counts. These show how a model selection approach flows naturally from the modeling goal, leading to different models selected for different purposes, even with exactly the same data set.

The response ratio (the ratio of mean outcome in the experimental group to that in the control group) and closely related measures of proportionate change are often used as measures of effect magnitude in ecology. Using these metrics for meta-analysis requires knowledge of their statistical properties, but these have not been previously derived. We give the approximate sampling distribution of the log response ratio, discuss why it is a particularly useful metric for many applications in ecology, and demonstrate how to use it in meta-analysis. The meta-analysis of response-ratio data is illustrated using experimental data on the effects of increased atmospheric CO2 on plant biomass responses.},

As a basis for systematically investigating intracellular H2O2 dynamics and regulation in living malaria parasites, we established the genetically encoded fluorescent H2O2 sensors roGFP2-Orp1 and HyPer-3 in Plasmodium falciparum. Both ratiometric redox probes as well as the pH control SypHer were expressed in the cytosol of blood-stage parasites. Both redox sensors showed reproducible sensitivity towards H2O2 in the lower micromolar range in vitro and in the parasites. Due to the pH sensitivity of HyPer-3, we used parasites expressing roGFP2-Orp1 for evaluation of short-, medium-, and long-term effects of antimalarial drugs on H2O2 levels and detoxification in Plasmodium. None of the quinolines or artemisinins tested had detectable direct effects on the H2O2 homeostasis at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. However, pre-treatment of the cells with antimalarial drugs or heat shock led to a higher tolerance towards exogenous H2O2. The systematic evaluation and comparison of the two genetically encoded cytosolic H2O2 probes in malaria parasites provides a basis for studying parasite-host cell interactions or drug effects with spatio-temporal resolution while preserving cell integrity.},

   abstract = {We propose an integrated sampling, rarefaction, and extrapolation methodology to compare species richness of a set of communities based on samples of equal completeness (as measured by sample coverage) instead of equal size. Traditional rarefaction or extrapolation to equal-sized samples can misrepresent the relationships between the richnesses of the communities being compared because a sample of a given size may be sufficient to fully characterize the lower diversity community, but insufficient to characterize the richer community. Thus, the traditional method systematically biases the degree of differences between community richnesses. We derived a new analytic method for seamless coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation. We show that this method yields less biased comparisons of richness between communities, and manages this with less total sampling effort. When this approach is integrated with an adaptive coverage-based stopping rule during sampling, samples may be compared directly without rarefaction, so no extra data is taken and none is thrown away. Even if this stopping rule is not used during data collection, coveragebased rarefaction throws away less data than traditional size-based rarefaction, and more efficiently finds the correct ranking of communities according to their true richnesses. Several hypothetical and real examples demonstrate these advantages. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Habitat fragmentation has become one of the largest areas of research in conservation biology. Empirical studies into habitat fragmentation impacts typically measure ecological responses to metrics describing fragmentation processes, for example ‘distance to the nearest forest edge’, ‘forest fragment area’ and ‘landscape habitat amount’. However, these studies often fail to sample across representative ranges of fragmentation metrics characterising the study region. They therefore lack the data to account for correlation among multiple fragmentation metrics and for spatial autocorrelation among sample sites, which reduces the strength of derived predictive models. Here, we draw on approaches used in the mining and soil science industry to develop standardised and repeatable protocols for designing optimised sampling schemes of biodiversity in fragmented landscapes that meet three criteria: the distance between sample sites is maximised to reduce spatial autocorrelation, the full range of values of the metrics of interest are sampled and the confounding effects of correlated metrics are minimised. We show that our computational methods can optimise the placement of sample sites in fragmented landscapes to minimise, and in some cases to entirely avoid, over- or under-sampling of fragmentation metrics. Our method is flexible enough to cater for any continuous (e.g. maps of percentage tree cover) or categorical (e.g. habitat and land use types) fragmentation metric, and to simultaneously handle combinations of multiple fragmentation metrics and habitat types. We implement our methods as open-source code which includes options to mask invalid or inaccessible regions, update designs to adapt to unforeseen constraints in the field and suggest optimal numbers of sample sites for given design criteria. Using a case study landscape, we demonstrate how the approach improves on manually generated sampling designs. We also show that the methods are flexible enough to be applied to landscape studies beyond the field of habitat fragmentation. We introduce our package as a novel research tool that is able to streamline the experimental design process for biodiversity sampling and monitoring at landscape scales, leading to improved data quality and representativeness.},

In this paper, the second version of the BMWQ score system is applied to two selected field studies (organic and nonorgahic pollution) in order to illustrate the suitable functional character of this method. The total BMWQ (t-BMWQ) score and the average BMWQ (a-BMWQ) score are calculated, and their relationships with diversity indices are also examined. The BMWQ method appears to be very sensitive to changes in freshwater quality generated by simple organic pollution, but this method appears to be less sensitive to changes generated by complex nonorganic pollution. In addition, both scores are more sensitive measures to assess macroinvertebrate response to organic pollution than total density and diversity indices, exhibiting higher positive coefficients of linear correlation with Camargo's diversity index than with Shannon's and MacArthur's diversity indices. However, the a-BMWQ score is more sensitive to changes in family composition than the t-BMWQ score, whereas this latter score is more sensitive to family richness and sample size. In this sense, the use of the a-BMWQ score is recommended for the biological assessment of freshwater quality degradation in the Iberian Peninsula. More information is obtained for less effort when the a-BMWQ score is used.},

The aim of this paper is to provide a unified framework for the assessment of beta diversity, disentangling the contribution of spatial turnover and nestedness to beta-diversity patterns. Innovation: I derive an additive partitioning of beta diversity that provides the two separate components of spatial turnover and nestedness underlying the total amount of beta diversity. I propose two families of measures of beta diversity for pairwise and multiple-site situations. Each family comprises one measure accounting for all aspects of beta diversity, which is additively decomposed into two measures accounting for the pure spatial turnover and nestedness components, respectively. Finally, I provide a case study using European longhorn beetles to exemplify the relevance of disentangling spatial turnover and nestedness patterns. Main conclusion: Assigning the different beta-diversity patterns to their respective biological phenomena is essential for analysing the causality of the processes underlying biodiversity. Thus, the differentiation of the spatial turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity is crucial for our understanding of central biogeographic, ecological and conservation issues. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of how to quantitatively characterise the degree to which a study object exhibits a generalised response. By generalised response, we mean a multivariate response where numerous individual properties change in concerted fashion due to some internal integration. In latent variable structural equation modelling (LVSEM), we would typically approach this situation using a latent variable to represent a general property of interest (e.g. performance) and multiple observed indicator variables that reflect the specific features associated with that general property. While ecologists have used LVSEM in a number of cases, there is substantial potential for its wider application. One obstacle is that LV models can be complex and easily over-specified, degrading their value as a means of generalisation. It can also be challenging to diagnose causes of misspecification and understand which model modifications are sensible. In this paper, we present a protocol, consisting of a series of questions, designed to guide the researchers through the evaluation process. These questions address: (1) theoretical development, (2) data requirements, (3) whether responses to perturbation are general, (4) unique reactions by individual measures and (5) how far generality can be extended. For this illustration, we reference a recent study considering the potential consequences of maintaining biodiversity as part of agricultural management on the overall quality of grapes used for wine-making. We extend our presentation to include the complexities that occur when there are multiple species with unique reactions.},

It is currently classified as deficient data (DD) by IUCN Red List of Endangered Species, requiring further knowledge about its geographic distribution and population status. In this context, the species distribution modeling can be applied, since its basis uses species occurrence records and environmental variables related to bioclimatic and landscape features. This kind of method predicts the species suitability of certain organism in the geographic space. We obtained 159 P. nordestinus occurrence records, covering all the previously known distribution of the species. These records were collected from direct field sampling, scientific literature, museum collections, and available online databases. We used four species distribution modeling algorithms to obtain the potential range (extent of occurrence) and available habitat for this frog through habitat area analysis proposed by IUCN. The generated models can be considered as excellent, with mean AUC value of 0.981. The environmental variables related to temperature and radiation were the most important to the construction of this distribution model. Our results indicate that the forested areas of the Atlantic Forest domain and forest patches inside the Caatinga biome present the highest suitability values for the species occurrence and the major part of available habitats, a fact possibly related to the known arboreal habit of this amphibian. We thus provide a new distribution area for P. nordestinus more broadly than previously known and a new polygon for conservation purposes based on extent of oc-currence, and an increase of occupancy based on habitat area analysis. The identification of additional areas where the P. nordestinus occurrence was not yet well known, new habitats for possible dispersal or recolonization; and the selection of conservation hotspots applied to this species are direct applica-tions from our study. In addition, the methodological procedures used here may serve as a baseline tool for new investigations with focus on still deficient data species and its ecological and conservation planning requirements.},

   abstract = {Functional richness, currently defined as the amount of niche space occupied by the species within a community, is one of the three major components of functional diversity. Different indices have been developed in order to quantify this component. However, the range of indices available for assessing functional richness, often mathematically complex and based on different rationales, can cause confusion for field ecologists and lead to misinterpretation of the results obtained. In this context, we have provided the first study exclusively focused on the comparison of the definitions, advantages and drawbacks of a large set of functional richness indices. The first part of this work is focused on four indices (FDP&G, FRic, TOP and N-hypervolumes indices) that are currently the most commonly used for assessing functional richness. We have completed our study by including recently developed indices that enable us to take into account the intraspecific trait variability (i.e. FRim index and TDP framework), because there is currently a growing scientific consensus regarding the necessity of including this aspect in the assessment of the functional diversity of communities. We demonstrate that although authors have argued that their index describes the functional richness, each of them describes only part of it, and this part may strongly differ from one index to another. Rather than advocating the general use of a single index and/or systematically avoiding others, our study highlights the need for selecting indices in close relation with the context, the available data and the aims of each study. Such a strategy is an essential preliminary step for preventing misunderstanding and artefactual controversies. Along these lines, we propose some guidelines to help users in selecting the most appropriate indices according both to the facet of functional richness on which they wish to focus and to the characteristics of the available data.},

Two fundamental properties of interactions are often overlooked during the process of hypothesising, visualising and interpreting interactions between drivers: the measurement scale – whether a response is analysed on an additive or multiplicative scale, such as a ratio or logarithmic scale; and the symmetry – whether dependencies are considered in both directions. Overlooking these properties can lead to one or more of three inferential errors: misinterpretation of (i) the detection and magnitude (Type-D error), and (ii) the sign of effect modification (Type-S error); and (iii) misidentification of the underlying processes (Type-A error). We illustrate each of these errors with a broad range of ecological questions applied to empirical and simulated data sets. We demonstrate how meta-analysis, a widely used approach that seeks explicitly to characterise context dependence, is especially prone to all three errors. Based on these insights, we propose guidelines to improve hypothesis generation, testing, visualisation and interpretation of interactions in ecology.},

Careful survey design helps attain that goal and, in part due to financial constraints, such design requires the balancing of hard monetary costs and the intangible benefit of improved ecological models.

The approach is illustrated on a citizen science database of roadkills in Taiwan, modelled as a Poisson point process on a linear road network. Our method has revealed some valuable locations that were not self-evident, for example, highlighting the possibility of sending volunteers to mountainous areas that despite being hard to reach, would provide valuable samples. We have also highlighted some ex situ sampling opportunities to avoid wasting resources by over-sampling hard to access locations. Our technique is not restricted to presence-only data, and in fact we present a general framework that can be applied to a wide range of settings by tuning its formulation. Our method is quite flexible and allows for more elaborate value functions, enabling managers to precisely quantify varied goals within the same framework.},

Previous work has extended these matching components to abundance-based measures of dissimilarity. Using these matching components in terms of species abundances I provide a novel partition separating two components of abundance-based dissimilarity: (i) balanced variation in abundance, whereby the individuals of some species in one site are substituted by the same number of individuals of different species in another site; and (ii) abundance gradients, whereby some individuals are lost from one site to the other. New indices deriving from the additive partition of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity are presented, each one accounting separately for these two antithetic components of assemblage variation. An example comparing the patterns of increase of assemblage dissimilarity with spatial distance in two tropical forests is provided to illustrate the usefulness of the novel partition to discern the different sources of assemblage variation. The widely used Bray-Curtis index of dissimilarity is the result of summing these two sources of dissimilarity, and therefore might consider equivalent patterns that are markedly different. Therefore, the novel partition may be useful to assess biodiversity patterns and to explore their causes, as substitution and loss of individuals are patterns that can derive from completely different processes. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

   abstract = {A wide variety of similarity indices for comparing two assemblages based on species incidence (i.e., presence/absence) data have been proposed in the literature. These indices are generally based on three simple incidence counts: the number of species shared by two assemblages and the number of species unique to each of them. We provide a new probabilistic derivation for any incidence-based index that is symmetric (i.e., the index is not affected by the identity ordering of the two assemblages) and homogeneous (i.e., the index is unchanged if all counts are multiplied by a constant). The probabilistic approach is further extended to formulate abundance-based indices. Thus any symmetric and homogeneous incidence index can be easily modified to an abundance-type version. Applying the Laplace approximation formulas, we propose estimators that adjust for the effect of unseen shared species on our abundance-based indices. Simulation results show that the adjusted estimators significantly reduce the biases of the corresponding unadjusted ones when a substantial fraction of species is missing from samples. Data on successional vegetation in six tropical forests are used for illustration.

Over the years, many software packages for structural equation modeling have been developed, both free and commercial. However, perhaps the best state-of-the-art software packages in this field are still closed-source and/or commercial. The R package lavaan has been developed to provide applied researchers, teachers, and statisticians, a free, fully open-source, but commercial-quality package for latent variable modeling. This paper explains the aims behind the development of the package, gives an overview of its most important features, and provides some examples to illustrate how lavaan works in practice.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a new and simple method to find indicator species and \nspecies assemblages characterizing groups of sites. The novelty of our approach lies in the way we combine a species relative abundance with its relative frequency of occurrence in the various groups of sites. This index is maximum when all individuals of a species are found in a single group of sites and when the species occurs in all sites of that group; it is a symmetric indicator. The statistical significance of the species indicator values is evaluated using a randomization procedure. Contrary to TWINSPAN, our indicator index for a given species is independent of the other species relative abundances, and there is no need to use pseudospecies. The new method identifies indicator species for typologies of species releve by any hierarchical or nonhierarchical classification procedure; its use is independent of the classification method. Because indicator species give ecological meaning to groups of sites, this method provides criteria to compare typologies, to identify where to stop dividing clusters into subsets, and to point out the main levels in a hierarchical classification of sites. \nSpecies can be grouped on the basis of their indicator values for each clustering level, the heterogeneous nature of species assemblages observed in any one site being well preserved. Such assemblages are usually a mixture of eurytopic (higher level) and stenotopic species (characteristic of lower level clusters). The species assemblage approach demonstrates the importance of the ‘‘sampled patch size,’’ i.e., the diversity of sampled ecological combinations, when we compare the frequencies of core and satellite species. A new way to present species–site tables, accounting for the hierarchical relationships among species, \nis proposed. A large data set of carabid beetle distributions in open habitats of Belgium is used as a case study to illustrate the new method.},

   abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) constitute the most common class of models across ecology, evolution and conservation. The advent of ready-to-use software packages and increasing availability of digital geoinformation have considerably assisted the application of SDMs in the past decade, greatly enabling their broader use for informing conservation and management, and for quantifying impacts from global change. However, models must be fit for purpose, with all important aspects of their development and applications properly considered. Despite the widespread use of SDMs, standardisation and documentation of modelling protocols remain limited, which makes it hard to assess whether development steps are appropriate for end use. To address these issues, we propose a standard protocol for reporting SDMs, with an emphasis on describing how a study's objective is achieved through a series of modeling decisions. We call this the ODMAP (Overview, Data, Model, Assessment and Prediction) protocol, as its components reflect the main steps involved in building SDMs and other empirically-based biodiversity models. The ODMAP protocol serves two main purposes. First, it provides a checklist for authors, detailing key steps for model building and analyses, and thus represents a quick guide and generic workflow for modern SDMs. Second, it introduces a structured format for documenting and communicating the models, ensuring transparency and reproducibility, facilitating peer review and expert evaluation of model quality, as well as meta-analyses. We detail all elements of ODMAP, and explain how it can be used for different model objectives and applications, and how it complements efforts to store associated metadata and define modelling standards. We illustrate its utility by revisiting nine previously published case studies, and provide an interactive web-based application to facilitate its use. We plan to advance ODMAP by encouraging its further refinement and adoption by the scientific community.},

   abstract = {Aims: This review was developed to introduce the essential components and variants of structural equation modeling (SEM), synthesize the common issues in SEM applications, and share our views on SEM’s future in ecological research. Methods: We searched the Web of Science on SEM applications in ecological studies from 1999 through 2016 and summarized the potential of SEMs, with a special focus on unexplored uses in ecology. We also analyzed and discussed the common issues with SEM applications in previous publications and presented our view for its future applications. Results: We searched and found 146 relevant publications on SEM applications in ecological studies. We found that five SEM variants had not commenly been applied in ecology, including the latent growth curve model, Bayesian SEM, partial least square SEM, hierarchical SEM, and variable/model selection. We identified ten common issues in SEM applications including strength of causal assumption, specification of feedback loops, selection of models and variables, identification of models, methods of estimation, explanation of latent variables, selection of fit indices, report of results, estimation of sample size, and the fit of model. Conclusions: In previous ecological studies, measurements of latent variables, explanations of model parameters, and reports of key statistics were commonly overlooked, while several advanced uses of SEM had been ignored overall. With the increasing availability of data, the use of SEM holds immense potential for ecologists in the future.},

   abstract = {The Atlantic Forest is reduced to less than 20 % of its original area, but it still protects an important biological heritage. Forest fragmentation makes the environment more susceptible to invasive species occupation. Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) was introduced into Brazil in the seventeenth century; and in the second half of the twentieth century, its natural regeneration increased the density of individuals, compromising the recruitment of many native species. This study investigated the impact of A. heterophyllus invasion on the diversity and tree structure component at the edge of an Atlantic Forest fragment, in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Two transect-type plots were set up with 10 m x 100 m (1,000 m 2), being divided into 10 subplots of 10 m x 10 m, with a total sampling area of 2,000 m 2. Trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) equals to or greater than 5 cm were tagged and DBH and total height measured. The following phytosociological parameters were estimated: Frequency (F), Density (D), Dominance (Do), Importance (IV) and Coverage (CV) Values. In total, 191 tree individuals were sampled. Invasive species made up more than 35% of the entire vegetation structure in the studied environment, ending in first place in terms of Importance Value (IV = 35.62%). Low floristic wealth seems to have favored the A. heterophyllus invasion process in the community, showing the need for an effective control of the species for the native genetic heritage protection.},

   abstract = {Patches of seasonally dry tropical forests occur on limestone outcrops in Central Brazil surrounded by the dominant savanna vegetation. They contain valuable timber species but are threatened by farming and mining activities. The objective of this study was to describe canopy opening and light relations in two seasonally deciduous dry forests on slopes and limestone outcrops, in the Paranã valley at the northeastern region of the Goiás state, Brazil. The studied forests were in the Fazenda Sabonete in Iaciara-Go and Fazenda Forquilha in Guarani-GO. Woody plants were sampled in 25 (20 x 20 m) plots in each forest. In the Sabonete forest 40 species, 705 ind./ha-1 with a basal area of 15.78 m²/ha-1 were found, while in Forquilha there were 55 species, 956 ind./ha-1 with a basal area of 24.76 m²/ha-1. Using hemispherical photographic techniques, 25 black and white photographs were taken at each site, during the dry season, totaling 50 photographs. These were taken at the beginning of each vegetation-sampling plot. The photographs were scanned in grey tones and saved as 'Bitmap'. The canopy opening and leaf area index (LAI) were calculated using the software Winphot. The mean canopy opening was 54.0% (±9.36) for Fazenda Sabonete and 64.6% (±11.8) in Fazenda Forquilha, with both sites presenting significant differences in the opening estimates (P < 0.05). Their floristic richness and structure also differed with the more open canopy forest, Forquilha, being richer and denser, suggesting the need for further studies on species-environment relationships in these forests. RESUMO-Manchas de florestas estacionais circundadas por vegetação de cerrado ocorrem em afloramentos calcários no Brasil central. Elas contêm espécies madeireiras valiosas, mas estão ameaçadas por atividades agropecuárias e de mineração. O objetivo deste estudo foi descrever a abertura de dossel e relações de luz em duas florestas estacionais em declive sobre afloramentos calcários, no Vale do Paranã, no nordeste de Goiás. As florestas estudadas localizaram-se na Fazenda Sabonete, em Iaciara, GO, e na Fazenda Forquilha, em Guarani, GO. A vegetação lenhosa foi amostrada em 25 parcelas de 20 x 20 m em cada floresta. Utilizando-se a técnica de fotografias hemisféricas, 25 fotos em preto e branco foram tomadas em cada local durante a estação seca, totalizando 50 fotos.

Species richness and presence/ absence were compared among ponds classified by the type offish present. Amphibian species richness was significantly lower at ponds having predatory fish present than at non-predatory, or fish-free, ponds. Not all amphibian species were negatively affected by the presence of predatory fish: those having either large bodies or clutch size co-occurred with predatory fish more frequently than those with small bodies or clutch size.

In this study, the feeding habits of three species of anurans (Rhinella fernandezae, Odontophrynus americanus and Physalaemus albonotatus) were compared between a soybean field and a native forest in Santa Fe Province, Argentina. Our dietary assessment is based on 124 individuals (47 R. fernandezae, 45 O. americanus and 32 P. albonotatus). Lepidopteran larvae were the predominant item in anuran diets from the soybean field, whereas collembola, isopods and snails prevailed in the diets from forests. Generally, the three anuran species shifted their diets as prey differs in the two environments, but R. fernandezae and P. albonotatus maintained a preference for a few prey types. Mean niche overlap in the soybean field was smaller than expected by chance, suggesting that the three anuran species are competing for limited resources. Trophic studies on other native anurans in agroecosystems should be a priority in conservation efforts due to their potential use as natural control agents, as well as for assessing the consequences of the broad conversion of natural forest to agricultural use in our region and throughout the world.},

The local species composition was more similar to assemblages from adjacent Caatinga ecoregions than to those from other areas within the same ecoregion. The inventoried lizard assemblage consisted of a few common species and a majority of low abundance ones, and its overall richness and abundance did not differ between rainy and dry months. Our findings demonstrated that the composition of lizard assemblages did not match with the current proposed Caatinga ecoregions, and revealed that the studied assemblage followed a lognormal species-abundance distribution, showing no significant seasonal fluctuation in richness and abundance.},

   abstract = {In many tropical frogs, offspring development and survival potentially depend on microhabitat features associated with sites that parents select for oviposition and tadpole rearing. We investigated the importance of microhabitat features in the selection of oviposition sites versus tadpole rearing sites, as well as in determining offspring survival, in the golden rocket frog, Anomaloglossus beebei. Endemic to Guyana, this species exhibits biparental care and exclusively uses phytotelmata in bromeliads for oviposition and tadpole rearing. We used model-based inference to evaluate evidence that parents prioritize different microhabitat features in selecting phytotelmata suitable for oviposition versus tadpole rearing and that microhabitat selection can adaptively promote offspring survival. For phytotelmata in 132 bromeliads, we quantified bromeliad size, phytotelm height, leaf angle (indicative of location within the bromeliad), water volume, water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, and the presence/absence of potential predators and nearby conspecifics. Compared to tadpole rearing sites, oviposition sites were found in phytotelmata associated with leaves at lower angles within bromeliads, smaller water volumes, lower water temperatures, higher dissolved oxygen concentrations, and more predatory crabs. Compared with unsuccessful egg clutches, successful clutches were found in phytotelmata with lower water temperatures, higher dissolved oxygen concentrations, fewer crabs, more dragonfly larvae, and more nearby conspecifics. We conclude that the nonrandom patterns of microhabitat use for oviposition sites and tadpole rearing sites in golden rocket frogs are associated with specific environmental factors that promote offspring survival through a critical stage of the animals’ complex life cycle.},

   abstract = {Understanding species distribution patterns is a central aim in ecology. Traditionally, the study of such patterns emphasizes the ecological traits of the organisms that allow them to interact with other species and with the environment. The perception that ecological differences may reflect the evolutionary history of a species has also highlighted the importance of considering phylogeny in studies of communities at different spatial scales. Based on this perspective, our goal was to investigate phylogenetic and ecological patterns in a community of anurans in a restinga (sandy coastal plain) environment on the northern coast of the state of Bahia, Brazil. First, we tested whether two ecomorphological traits of the studied species presented phylogenetic signal. Then, we analyzed the phylogenetic and ecological relationships of the anuran species that coexisted in the same spatial unit using the net relatedness index (NRI) and nearest related-taxon index (NTI). The results indicated that ecomorphological traits were conserved in the evolutionary history of the studied species. Furthermore, the anuran community was not phylogenetically structured, but there was a trend toward phylogenetic and ecological overdispersion, with an emphasis on the latter. This result suggests that the stochastic (related to dispersion of individuals) and deterministic processes (as interactions between species and between species and the environment) are likely acting together and affecting the investigated community at the local scale. The observed patterns could be explained by (i) the phylogenetic and ecological singularity of Pristimantis paulodutrai, a dominant species in the community, and (ii) high environmental diversity, which might have diversified the environment and increased the co-occurrence of many ecological traits related to habitat use by species, regardless of whether these differences were reflected in the phylogenetic structure of the community. Better insights will be achieved by combining phylogenetic, ecological, and environmental data to clarify the processes that structure anuran communities at different spatial scales.},

   abstract = {The structure of the environment surrounding signal emission produces different patterns of degradation and attenuation. The expected adjustment of calls to ensure signal transmission in an environment was formalized in the acoustic adaptation hypothesis. Within this framework, most studies considered anuran calls as fixed attributes determined by local adaptations. However, variability in vocalizations as a product of phenotypic expression has also been reported. Empirical evidence supporting the association between environment and call structure has been inconsistent, particularly in anurans. Here, we identify a plausible causal structure connecting environment, individual attributes, and temporal and spectral adjustments as direct or indirect determinants of the observed variation in call attributes of the frog Hypsiboas pulchellus. For that purpose, we recorded the calls of 40 males in the field, together with vegetation density and other environmental descriptors of the calling site. Path analysis revealed a strong effect of habitat structure on the temporal parameters of the call, and an effect of site temperature conditioning the size of organisms calling at each site and thus indirectly affecting the dominant frequency of the call. Experimental habitat modification with a styrofoam enclosure yielded results consistent with field observations, highlighting the potential role of call flexibility on detected call patterns. Both, experimental and correlative results indicate the need to incorporate the so far poorly considered role of phenotypic plasticity in the complex connection between environmental structure and individual call attributes. © The Author 2011.},

   abstract = {Begging by nestling birds has been used to test evolutionary models of signalling but theory has outstripped evidence. Eavesdropping predators potentially impose a cost on begging that ensures signal honesty, yet little experimental evidence exists for such a cost at active nests because the use of artificial nests, long playback bouts and absence of parents may have exaggerated costs. We broadcast short periods (1 h) of either nestling vocalizations or background noise at active white-browed scrubwren, Sericornis frontalis, nests. Nestlings called naturally during both treatments, allowing us to test whether elevated calling increases risk, a key but rarely tested assumption of evolutionary models. Predators visited nests exclusively during periods of elevated calling. Furthermore, playbacks affected neither adult visits nor nestling activity, suggesting that calling alone attracted predators. Adults gave alarm calls and nestlings usually called less when predators approached nests. Predation risk to broods is, therefore, likely to fluctuate substantially over short periods of time, depending on nestling hunger and whether adults or young have detected predators. This study confirms a present-day cost of nestling begging, demonstrates that this cost can be incurred over short periods and supports the importance of parent- offspring antipredator strategies in reducing predation risk. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

   abstract = {The efficacy of communication relies on detection of species-specific signals against the background noise. Features affecting signal detection are thus expected to evolve under selective pressures represented by masking noise. Spectral partitioning between the auditory signals of co-occurring species has been interpreted as the outcome of the selective effects of masking interference. However, masking interference depends not only on signal's frequency but on receiver's range of frequency sensitivity; moreover, selection on signal frequency can be confounded by selection on body size, because these traits are often correlated. To know whether geographic variation in communication traits agrees with predictions about masking interference effects, we tested the hypothesis that variation in the male-male communication system of the Amazonian frog, Allobates femoralis, is correlated with the occurrence of a single species calling within an overlapping frequency range, Epipedobates trivittatus. We studied frogs at eight sites, four where both species co-occur and four where A. femoralis occurs but E. trivittatus does not. To study the sender component of the communication system of A. femoralis and to describe the use of the spectral range, we analyzed the signal's spectral features of all coactive species at each site. To study the receiver component, we derived frequency-response curves from playback experiments conducted on territorial males of A. femoralis under natural conditions. Most geographic variation in studied traits was correlated with either call frequency or with response frequency range. The occurrence of E. trivittatus significantly predicted narrower and asymmetric frequency-response curves in A. femoralis, without concomitant differences in the call or in body size. The number of acoustically coactive species did not significantly predict variation in any of the studied traits. Our results strongly support that the receiver but not the sender component of the communication system changed due to masking interference by a single species.},

On the other hand, frogs are not expected to play a role in these interactions, as nearly all species are carnivorous (mostly insectivorous) after metamorphosis. However, one species attracts attention: Xenohyla truncata, which includes plant parts on its natural diet. Recently, we observed unexpected interactions between this Neotropical treefrog and plants in their native range. The frog fed on different plant parts, consuming fruits, floral structures and nectar with suction-like movements, and we observed pollen grains adhered to the frog's back, which renders this treefrog as a potential pollinator, besides its already established role as seed disperser. Nectar ingestion during the reproductive season could benefit individuals under high energetic demand. This is a unique and outstanding example of unforeseen interactions between amphibians and plants.},

Numerous species have declined and require to be objectively evaluated and quantified, as a step towards the development of conservation strategies. Herein, we present an updated National Red List Assessment for amphibian species of Ecuador, with one of the most detailed and complete coverages for any Ecuadorian taxonomic group to date. Based on standardized methodologies that integrate taxonomic work, spatial analyses, and ecological niche modeling, we assessed the extinction risk and identified the main threats for all Ecuadorian native amphibians (635 species), using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. Our evaluation reveals that 57% (363 species) are categorized as Threatened, 12% (78 species) as Near Threatened, 4% (26 species) as Data Deficient, and 27% (168 species) as Least Concern. Our assessment almost doubles the number of threatened species in comparison with previous evaluations. In addition to habitat loss, the expansion of the agricultural/cattle raising frontier and other anthropogenic threats (roads, human settlements, and mining/oil activities) amplify the incidence of other pressures as relevant predictors of ecological integrity. Potential synergic effects with climate change and emergent diseases (apparently responsible for the sudden declines), had particular importance amongst the threats sustained by Ecuadorian amphibians. Most threatened species are distributed in montane forests and paramo habitats of the Andes, with nearly 10% of them occurring outside the National System of Protected Areas of the Ecuadorian government. Based on our results, we recommend the following actions: (i) An increase of the National System of Protected Areas to include threatened species. (ii) Supporting the ex/in-situ conservation programs to protect species considered like Critically Endangered and Endangered. (iii) Focalizing research efforts towards the description of new species, as well as species currently categorized as Data Deficient (DD) that may turn out to be threatened. The implementation of the described actions is challenging, but urgent, given the current conservation crisis faced by amphibians.},

   abstract = {The popularity of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI) has risen sharply in recent years. Despite this spike in popularity, the inner workings of ML and DL algorithms are often perceived as opaque, and their relationship to classical data analysis tools remains debated. Although it is often assumed that ML and DL excel primarily at making predictions, ML and DL can also be used for analytical tasks traditionally addressed with statistical models. Moreover, most recent discussions and reviews on ML focus mainly on DL, failing to synthesise the wealth of ML algorithms with different advantages and general principles. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the field of ML and DL, starting by summarizing its historical developments, existing algorithm families, differences to traditional statistical tools, and universal ML principles. We then discuss why and when ML and DL models excel at prediction tasks and where they could offer alternatives to traditional statistical methods for inference, highlighting current and emerging applications for ecological problems. Finally, we summarize emerging trends such as scientific and causal ML, explainable AI, and responsible AI that may significantly impact ecological data analysis in the future. We conclude that ML and DL are powerful new tools for predictive modelling and data analysis. The superior performance of ML and DL algorithms compared to statistical models can be explained by their higher flexibility and automatic data-dependent complexity optimization. However, their use for causal inference is still disputed as the focus of ML and DL methods on predictions creates challenges for the interpretation of these models. Nevertheless, we expect ML and DL to become an indispensable tool in ecology and evolution, comparable to other traditional statistical tools.},

Overall, amphibians are the most sedentary vertebrates, but poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) routinely shuttle tadpoles from terrestrial territories to dispersed aquatic deposition sites. We hypothesize that dendrobatid frogs rely on learning for flexible navigation. We tested the role of experience with the local cues for poison frog way-finding by (i) experimentally displacing territorial males of Allobates femoralis over several hundred metres, (ii) using a harmonic direction finder with miniature transponders to track these small frogs, and (iii) using a natural river barrier to separate the translocated frogs from any familiar landmarks. We found that homeward orientation was disrupted by the translocation to the unfamiliar area but frogs translocated over similar distances in their local area showed significant homeward orientation and returned to their territories via a direct path. We suggest that poison frogs rely on spatial learning for way-finding in their local area.},

   abstract = {Multimodal signals convey information that can be detected by receivers using two or more sensory modalities. The information transmitted through secondary channels may be mostly useless, redundant, complementary, or essential. Although each option implies different evolutionary scenarios, the relative role of signal subcomponents in a secondary channel has rarely been tested. Anuran amphibians are known for their extensive use of auditory signals, but growing evidence suggests their common use of multimodal signals where the visual component represents the secondary channel. Territorial males of the nontoxic frog Allobates femoralis use bimodal (acoustic + visual) signals to recognize conspecific intruders. We used playback experiments to test the relative importance of three visual subcomponents (body coloration, body size and body movement) in a multimodal signal to elicit agonistic reactions in males. The probability of attack was highly related to the movement and size of a dummy frog but very poorly related to dummy's coloration. The results suggest that any body movement, and not only vocal sac movement, is a nonredundant component of a bimodal signal that probably modulates male aggression. Against our expectations, males readily attacked dummy frogs painted to mimic the co-occurring frog Ameerega trivittata as well as models lacking some of their own pattern's subcomponents (white lines and yellow patches). Colourful frogs did not use body coloration as a visual cue for conspecific recognition. Both patterns recall the importance of carefully manipulating the availability of visual information in interpreting the origin and evolution of multimodal signals. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

   abstract = {Incubation temperature is among the main phenotypic trait variation drivers studied since the developmental trajectory of oviparous animals is directly affected by environmental conditions. In the last decades, global warming predictions have aroused interest in understanding its impacts on biodiversity. It is predicted that the effects of direct warming will be exacerbated by other anthropogenic factors, such as microclimatic edge effects. Although the Brazilian Cerrado biome is one of the most affected by these issues, little is known about the aforementioned effects on its biodiversity. Therefore, the aim of our study is to investigate the influence of incubation temperature on developmental parameters, morphology and thermal physiology traits of the collared lizard (Tropidurus torquatus). Furthermore, we discuss our findings regarding lizard developmental biology and the climate change paradigm. Therefore, we incubated T. torquatus eggs under five temperature regimes ranging from artificial nest temperature (28.7 °C) to 35.0 °C. We found that elevated incubation temperatures affect several investigated traits: egg mass gain is positively affected, without any influence in newborn mass; incubation period is broadly reduced with temperature increase; survival rate is negatively affected by temperature, constant 35.0 °C regime is confirmed as a lethal incubation temperature, and the sex ratio is affected at 30.0 °C, with a prevailing outbreak of females. Increased incubation temperature also affects body and head size but has no effect on limb size. Newborn thermoregulation and the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) are not affected by incubation temperature. On the other hand, basal body temperature (Tbb) and the critical thermal minimum (CTmin) were positively affected. Thermal physiology was also affected by age, with newborns differing from adults for all analyzed thermal traits. Our findings indicate that future modifications in incubation temperature regimes at nesting sites caused by warming may affect several features of the development, morphology, and thermal physiology of newborns of this species. Laboratory experiments have pointed to possible drastic effects of warming on lizard survival rates, also affecting aspects of its natural history and population distribution. Moreover, in addition to being more vulnerable than adults in aspects such as predation and feeding, T. torquatus newborns are also more vulnerable regarding thermal physiological traits.},

   abstract = {Environmental legislation has fostered ecological restoration programs worldwide, but few studies have reported the outcomes for landscape connectivity. Here, we investigated the contribution of forest restoration programs planned to comply with the Brazilian Forest Code for increasing forest cover and landscape connectivity in agricultural landscapes of southeastern Brazil. We gathered data for 85 landscapes and 2,408 rural properties, totalizing 748,601 ha of farmlands within the Atlantic Forest biome and its ecotone with Cerrado, two global hotspots for biodiversity conservation. Together, rural properties account for 50,783 ha of native vegetation deficit found on Areas of Permanent Protection (APPs). On the basis of this, we performed a landscape connectivity analysis by simulating scenarios in accordance with the requirements of the legislation for two sugarcane mills that are already under ongoing restoration efforts. We evaluated the relative changes promoted by restoring all deforested riparian buffers within APPs, as determined by the Forest Code. The simulation of restoration at the property-level resulted in the reconnection of isolated forest patches, reducing their number in the landscape and increasing their overall and core size. At the sugarcane mill level, the restoration of riparian forests increased the index of connectivity. Despite these benefits, final forest cover (remnant plus restored forests) would still be reduced (<20%—the minimum forest cover on the private land to comply with the environmental law) in most landscapes and insufficient to conserve species sensitive to forest fragmentation. The mandatory restoration of riparian buffers plays a relevant role for improving landscape connectivity in human-modified tropical landscapes, but this strategy shall be complemented by other approaches to increase forest cover and landscape connectivity to mitigate the enormous species extinction debt accumulated for tropical forests.},

   abstract = {Abstract: Most male frogs produce calls to attract females and repel rivals. The transmission of these calls can be affected by many acoustic and environmental characteristics, which can influence the detection and decoding of the signal by the receiver. Calling-perch height has a strong influence on sound propagation and acoustic spacing with neighboring males, but how frogs optimize their calling behavior in this context is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated if and how frogs can adjust the calling energy in the context of acoustic spacing. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between calling-perch height, nearest-neighbor distance, and sound-pressure level in the brilliant-thighed poison frog Allobates femoralis. We found that frogs flexibly adjust the calling amplitude according to the calling-perch height without affecting the effectiveness signal propagation. Accompanying signal propagation experiments demonstrated that calls produced with lower amplitude from higher perches propagate similar to louder calls from the ground. Our results suggest an adjustment to the hypothesis of a general positive effect of calling-perch height on signal effectiveness, where highly territorial frogs adjust their calling behavior to reduce energy expenditure and optimize acoustic communication with conspecifics. Significance statement: In acoustically communicating species, sound propagates better when broadcasted from elevated positions. However, callers may adjust their calling behavior to optimize the sound transmission under ecological constraints. By using a correlative and manipulative approach, we show in a poison frog model that males can adjust their calling amplitude according to the calling-perch height. We then discuss that this calling adjustment optimizes the acoustic spacing between conspecific males and reduces energy consumption.},

Proactive policies targeting how, where, and what food is produced could reduce these threats, with a combination of approaches potentially preventing almost all these losses while contributing to healthier human diets. As international biodiversity targets are set to be updated in 2021, these results highlight the importance of proactive efforts to safeguard biodiversity by reducing demand for agricultural land.},

   abstract = {Aim: Amphibians exhibit unusually diverse reproductive modes, including a wide array of parental care strategies. The evolutionary drivers of this diversity, however, remain unclear. Here, we investigate three major factors that might predict interspecific variation in parental care strategies: climate, intrasexual selection and social environment. We hypothesize that some forms of care evolved to cope with harsh conditions, such as dry or unpredictable habitats. We contrast this prediction with the hypothesis that parental roles have co-evolved with the social environment and mating systems. Location: Global. Major taxa studied: Frogs and toads (Amphibia: Anura). Time period: Extant taxa that represent c. 220 Myr of evolutionary history. Methods: Using geographical and behavioural data for 971 species of frogs and toads that represent 45 anuran families, we quantified the global distribution of four forms of parenting separately for males and females: nest building, nest and/or tadpole attendance, carrying and nourishment. We used phylogenetic comparative analyses to investigate whether climate, social environment and mating systems predicted interspecific variation in parental care. Results: Our results showed that climatic effects contribute to parental care diversity: in cool and humid climates the males provide offspring attendance, whereas in predictable temperatures endotrophy occurs, whereby the female provides all nutrients for the offspring until metamorphosis. In addition, we found other associations between mating systems and forms of parental care: uniparental clutch attendance by males is present in species with territorial defence, whereas cooperative nest building co-occurs with sperm competition. The type of parental care is not associated with adult sex ratios. Main conclusions: No specific form of care is associated with hostile environments; in fact, some forms of care occur in beneficial conditions, whereas others are used independently from the climate. Instead, parenting diversity has co-evolved closely with mating systems in frogs.},

In species that exhibit long-term territoriality, high homing performance after tadpole transport can be assumed, but experimental evidence is lacking, and the underlying orientation mechanisms are unknown. We conducted a field translocation experiment to test whether male Allobates femoralis, a dendrobatid frog with paternal extra-territorial tadpole transport, are capable of homing after experimental removal, as well as to quantify homing success and speed.

However, assessment of the potential impacts caused by sea level rise on biodiversity is still emerging. Therefore, we assessed the combined impact of global warming and sea level rise on the potential distribution of 19 coastal lowland anurans in the biodiversity hotspot Atlantic Forest. We applied a correlative species distribution model (SDM) (BIOCLIM) and GIS-based spatial analyses. We evaluated the extent of changes of potential distributions under extreme and moderate global warming scenarios as well as two extreme sea level rise scenarios. Our results suggest wide areas of suitable habitat for most species in the future. However, for 15% of these species the SDMs predict massive losses of range extent as a result of a combination of global warming and sea level rise. Such observations highlight an immediate need to consider the potential effects of sea level rise in conservation action plans. Since the current potential distribution of these anuran species is likely underestimated, we also analyzed their environmental niche under current conditions in order to provide a baseline for further field surveys. Considering this current state of knowledge for such species, species distribution modeling to help gather further information on unknown species is desirable.},

Herein, we investigate the diversification history and phylogenetic relationship among the Atlantic Forest Pristimantis lineages in a spatial-temporal framework, using mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Our results reveal a remarkable hidden diversity, with nine highly structure lineages that may correspond to undescribed species, with many cases of sympatry among these divergent lineages. Atlantic forest Pristimantis form a monophyletic group that started to diversify over 40 million years ago. This ancient group shows diversification events that remount the early bursts of the Atlantic Forest diversification history, as well as lineage diversification likely resulting from recent Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. Future work must concentrate in comparing these lineages under an integrative framework including morphology, advertisement calls and other ecology traits to confidently delimit species of Pristimantis in the Atlantic Forest.},

Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of untidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

   abstract = {Aim: We examined the geographical distribution of functional diversity for American amphibians and tested the relationship between functional diversity and environment. We also explored how the functional evenness of life-history traits varies across biogeographical regions. Location: Continental Americas. Methods: We performed a trait classification based on an Eltonian approach and calculated functional diversity using Hill numbers, Shannon and Gini–Simpson indices. We tested the relationship between functional diversity and different axes of environmental variation by using a series of spatial autoregressive (SAR) models. Results: Based on 212 different functional attributes for 2,776 species, we found that functional diversity has a latitudinal gradient consistent with that of species richness, regardless of the diversity index used. Evenness of functional diversity of amphibian assemblages varies depending on the region, but in general they are close to the maximum possible value. Areas with more functional richness relative to species richness are associated with high annual precipitation and low precipitation seasonality regardless of temperature; in contrast, areas with fewer functions than expected are associated with high aridity. Main conclusions: The highest functional diversity is located in mountainous regions. Overall, functional diversity is positively correlated with humid environments with low precipitation seasonality and low aridity regardless of temperature. This is especially relevant for amphibians facing contemporary climate change because it suggests that future variation in rainfall patterns, but not in annual mean temperature, might interact with functional diversity to pose an imminent threat to amphibian functional diversity.},

   abstract = {Tree-fall gaps are small-scale disturbances whose formation, colonization, and role in forest dynamics are well documented, but whose effects on animal ecology are still greatly overlooked, except for studies comparing species richness of gaps 6+ months old to that in the closed canopy. Other factors associated with the invasion of fresh tree-fall gaps such as animal breeding adaptations have been largely neglected. I studied the immediate (within hours and days) arrival of the poison frog Dendrobates tinctorius in new tree-fall gaps to examine the dynamics of their invasion in relation to tadpole rearing. I found that rearing sites are occupied sooner and tadpoles deposited at higher rates in fresh gaps than in the closed forest, but that the rate of cannibalism is also much greater in the former. This suggests that invading new tree-fall gaps can be the best parental decision when parents arrive early because they get access to fresh, high-quality resources, but it could be to the detriment of the offspring if parents arrive late, because of overcrowding and cannibalism. These results highlight the importance of studying the earliest stages of invasions in order to have a better understanding of the composition of communities in disturbed ecosystems at later successional stages. Habitat disturbances may enable the exploitation of resources previously unavailable. Dyeing poison frogs invade fresh treefall gaps as soon as they form, presumably in part searching for tadpole rearing sites. This study shows how the benefits of a new resource available may trade-off with the costs of crowding and over-use.},

Commonly, territory size is assessed through territory mapping and the application of simple area estimators such as minimum convex polygons. In the present study we demonstrate that territory size can be determined adequately with an active approach through intrusion experiments, a technique that is commonly used in behavioural research in other contexts. Tests with simulated data indicate that a minimum of twelve trials needs to be performed to establish reliable orders of relative territory size. To estimate absolute territory size, detailed hull techniques are most appropriate when analyzing point patterns of intrusion experiments, while the local convex hull estimator enables the construction of internal utilization distributions based on such point patterns. Additionally we suggest a 'stretch the centre' approach to emphasize the actual process of intrusion experiments in the construction of internal utilization distributions. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we apply all findings from the simulations to data from fieldwork with the model species Allobates femoralis, a territorial aromobatid frog from the lowland rainforest of French Guiana. © 2011 Ringler et al.},

Here we develop and apply a multicriteria optimization approach that identifies priority areas for restoration across all terrestrial biomes, and estimates their benefits and costs. We find that restoring 15% of converted lands in priority areas could avoid 60% of expected extinctions while sequestering 299 gigatonnes of CO2—30% of the total CO2 increase in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution. The inclusion of several biomes is key to achieving multiple benefits. Cost effectiveness can increase up to 13-fold when spatial allocation is optimized using our multicriteria approach, which highlights the importance of spatial planning.

This is also the case in north-eastern Madagascar; a region that retains significant proportions of forest cover despite slash-and-burn shifting hill rice cultivation and vanilla agroforestry expansion. The region is also a global hotspot for herpetofauna diversity, but how amphibians and reptiles are affected by land-use change remains largely unknown. Using a space-for-time study design, we compared species diversity and community composition across seven prevalent land uses: unburned (old-growth forest, forest fragment, and forest-derived vanilla agroforest) and burned (fallow-derived vanilla agroforest, woody fallow, and herbaceous fallow) land-use types, and rice paddy. We conducted six comprehensive, time-standardized searches across at least 10 replicates per land-use type and applied genetic barcoding to confirm species identification. We documented an exceptional diversity of herpetofauna (119 species; 91% endemic). Observed plot-level amphibian species richness was significantly higher in old-growth forest than in all other land-use types. Plot-level reptile species richness was significantly higher in unburned land-use types compared with burned land-use types. For both amphibians and reptiles, the less-disturbed land-use types showed more uneven communities and the species composition in old-growth forest differed significantly from all other land-use types. Amphibians had higher forest dependency (38% of species occurred exclusively in old-growth forest) than reptiles (26%). Our analyses thus revealed that the two groups respond differently to land-use change: we found less pronounced losses of reptile species richness especially in unburned agricultural habitats, suggesting that reptiles are less susceptible to land-use change than amphibians, possibly due to their ability to cope with hotter and drier microclimates. In conclusion, our findings emphasize existing conservation opportunities – especially for reptiles – in extensive agricultural landscapes while highlighting the precarious situation of amphibians in disappearing old-growth forests.},

The processes involved in how and why animals communicate have long held veritable fascination for scientists. A branch of science concerned with the production of sound and its effects on living organisms is bioacoustics. The main purpose of the present study is to raise and discuss some issues related to the relationship between animals, their sounds and ecology, including presentation of methods of analysis of sound recordings. A better understanding of the relationship between the studied animals will allow for development of a better framework for future research, as well as a better grasp of interactions between different organisms, including humans. The paper discusses the significance of acoustic research in animal ecology and its possible applications in the future. The author also summarizes previous research in the field of sound communication of various animal species. The paper proves that vocalizations of every acoustically communicating animal are threatened by climate change. For marine animals, the source of changes in vocalization abilities is ocean acidification and increased ambient noise, which can affect communication and foraging behavior. For terrestrial animals, changes in precipitation and temperature may result in modifications of the sounds emitted, as well as certain modifications to the auditory system. Together with changes in species distribution due to environmental parameters, cumulatively these factors can cause changes in the entire landscape of acoustics ecosystems. Thanks to acoustic biomonitoring, we can understand how the sounds of entire habitats and acoustic ecosystems will change in response to the changing climate and how it will affect bioacoustics on a global scale.},

   abstract = {Tropical rainforests are populated by large frugivores that feed upon fruit-producing woody species, yet their role in regulating the cycle of globally important biogeochemical elements such as nitrogen is still unknown. This is particularly relevant because tropical forests play a prominent role in the nitrogen cycle and are becoming rapidly defaunated. Furthermore, frugivory is not considered in current plant-large herbivore-nutrient cycling frameworks exclusively focused on grazers and browsers. Here we used a long-term replicated paired control-exclusion experiment in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, where peccaries and tapirs are the largest native frugivores, to examine the impact of large ground-dwelling frugivores on modulating soil nitrogen cycling, considering their effects across a gradient of abundance of a hyper-dominant palm. We found that both large frugivores and dominant palms play a substantial role in modulating ammonium availability and nitrification rates. Large frugivores increased ammonium by 95%, which also increased additively with palm abundance. Nitrification rates increased with palm abundance in the presence of large frugivores, but not on exclosure plots. Large frugivores also stimulated the regulation of the functions of soil-nitrifying microorganisms, and modulated the landscape-scale variance in nitrogen availability. Such joint effects of large frugivores and palms are consistent with the notion of ‘fruiting lawns’. Our study indicates that frugivory plays a pivotal role in zoogeochemistry in tropical forests by regulating and structuring the nitrogen cycle, urging to accommodate frugivory in plant-large herbivore-nutrient cycling frameworks. It also indicates that defaunation, deforestation and illegal palm and timber harvesting seriously affect nitrogen cycling in tropical forests, that play a prominent role in the global cycle of this nutrient.

Indicator species are often determined using an analysis of the relationship between the species occurrence or abundance values from a set of sites and the classification of the same sites into site groups (habitat types, community types, disturbance states, etc.). It may happen, however, that a particular site group has no indicator species even if its sites have a community composition that is clearly distinct from the sites of other site groups. This motivates an exploration of the indicator value of not only individual species but also species combinations. 2. Here, we present a novel statistical approach to determine indicators of site groups using species data. Unlike traditional indicator value analysis, we allow indicators to be species combinations in addition to single species. We require that all the species forming the combination must occur in the site to use the combination as an indicator. We present a simple algorithm that identifies the set of indicators (each one being either a single species or a species combination) that show high positive predictive value for the target site group. Moreover, we demonstrate the use of the percentage of sites of the site group where at least one of its valid indicators occurs to determine whether the group can be reliably predicted throughout its range. 3. Using a simulation study, we show that if two species are not strongly correlated and their frequency in the data set is larger than the frequency of sites belonging to the site group, the joint occurrence of the two species has higher positive predictive value for the site group than the two species taken independently. 4. We illustrate the proposed method by determining which combinations of vascular plants can be used as indicators for 29 shrubland and forest vegetation types of New Zealand. 5. The proposed methodology extends traditional indicator value analyses and will be useful to develop multispecies ecological or environmental indicators. Further, it will allow newly surveyed sites to be reliably assigned to previously defined vegetation types. © 2012 The Authors. Methods in Ecology and Evolution © 2012 British Ecological Society.},

   abstract = {Understanding the processes that drive patterns of beta diversity is crucial for planning conservation policies and for designing networks of protected area (PAs). Beta diversity can be decomposed into two components: 1—species turnover, the replacement of species by others resulting in a low proportion of shared species; 2—species nestedness—the result of differences in species richness, when a poorer community is a subset of species from a richer community. We aimed to evaluate beta diversity patterns and how they are represented in the network of PAs in southern Brazilian, regarding three forest types: Atlantic Forest s.s., Araucaria Forest, and Seasonal Forest. Beta diversity was partitioned into the turnover and nestedness components. Additionally, we examined spatial patterns of site similarity using distance decay curves. Beta diversity was mainly caused by species turnover (approx. 86%), with only a small contribution of nestedness (approx. 5%) in all three forests types. The patterns of distance decay curves revealed that even at small distances (50–100 km), we found a considerable decrease in similarities, reinforcing turnover patterns. As turnover brought the larger contribution to beta diversity, additional conservation efforts must target an increase in the number of PAs, that should be spread across each one of the regions, to maximize the protection of species diversity. Most of the PAs are currently limited to the eastern region and prioritize the Atlantic Forest s.s. Thus Araucaria Forest and Seasonal Forest should deserve special priority in new conservation actions, as they also contain high levels of species turnover.},

The impact of Bd on amphibians is determined by the host's immune system, of which the skin microbiome is a critical component. The richness and diversity of such cutaneous bacterial communities are known to be shaped by abiotic factors which thus may indirectly modulate host susceptibility to Bd. This study aimed to contribute to understanding the environment-host–pathogen interaction determining skin bacterial communities in 819 treefrogs (Anura: Hylidae and Phyllomedusidae) from 71 species sampled across the AF. We investigated whether abiotic factors influence the bacterial community richness and structure on the amphibian skin. We further tested for an association between skin bacterial community structure and Bd co-occurrence. Our data revealed that temperature, precipitation, and elevation consistently correlate with richness and diversity of the skin microbiome and also predict Bd infection status. Surprisingly, our data suggest a weak but significant positive correlation of Bd infection intensity and bacterial richness. We highlight the prospect of future experimental studies on the impact of changing environmental conditions associated with global change on environment-host–pathogen interactions in the AF.},

They possess important levels of species richness and endemism but few studies have assessed the diversity patterns and ecological relationships between the entire avifauna of these threatened forests. Thus, in order to analyse the macro-ecological patterns and the community structure of NSDF avifaunas, we generated species distribution models describing the current geographical distribution of 1,298 bird species inhabiting NSDF. We assessed species richness gradients in terms of distance from the Equator using both linear and polynomial regressions. Then, based on a matrix composed of the presence or absence of species in 563 quadrants, we performed cluster analyses (considering the Simpson dissimilarity index [βSIM] as a distance measure) to identify the main NSDF regions and describe the avifaunal affinities among them. For the identified groups, we estimated the dissimilarity values, using both an ANOSIM test and the βSIM index. Overall, we observed the lack of an equatorial peak for species diversity of NSDF avifauna in the latitudinal gradient and identified 12 avifaunistic groups. The βSIM index among the NSDF avifaunal groups ranged from 0.05-0.73, showing statistically significant differences (R = 0.894, p = 0.001) in species composition among them. Species shared between two or three NSDF groups comprised a higher proportion (â¼38%) than those exclusive to each group (â¼23%). Only 35 species were shared between the 12 groups. This information supports a separation of the NSDF avifauna into two major groups (northern and southern), as well as the idea of connections during recent geological time among the NSDF in southeastern South America (the so-called Pleistocene Arc Hypothesis). We provide a scientific framework to contextualise the importance of each NSDF nuclei in terms of their avifauna, supplying an ecological basis for future conservation decisions in order to protect their diversity.},

We sampled specimens and ecological data using both active search and pitfall traps to sample sites for 15 days during dry and wet seasons. Assemblages from Caatinga were more structured on dietary niche than those from Atlantic Forest. Ecological factors had a higher effect on the trophic niche than on the spatial niche but were lower than historical factors, thus indicating past adaptations. The onset of the dry season usually increases the dietary structure of assemblages. Water restrictions in Caatinga affected prey abundance, increasing niche segregation. Differences between environments indicated that local factors exerted greater influence in Caatinga. We did not observe spatial niche structure in most assemblages, regardless of the environment, and we found strong evidence of niche conservatism in all assemblages. Phylogenetic effects detected in spatial niches reinforce the separation between arboreal and terrestrial/semi-aquatic lineages during the Cretaceous. Lastly, no niche complementarity was detected, despite the different structure patterns. No assemblage was phylogenetically structured, and the existence of a possible "ecological filter'' in Caatinga did not lead to increased "phylogenetic clustering'' in this environment.},

From the field survey, we found that (1) lizards from the least disturbed site and (2) operative temperature models of lizards placed in the least disturbed site had lower temperatures than those from sites with histories of human disturbance. Individuals from the least disturbed site also demonstrated greater tolerance to high temperatures than those from the more disturbed sites, in both their critical thermal maxima and the time spent at high temperatures prior to reaching critical thermal maxima.

Explicitly recognizing the relative habitat value of prevalent land uses in comparison to forest will help improve conservation theory and practice in human-modified landscapes. To better understand how common land uses influence habitat quality and buffer forest fragments in tropical landscapes, we characterized reptile and amphibian assemblages across forest-pasture and forest-peach palm (palmito) ecotones in northeastern Costa Rica. We found that forest remnants contained significantly greater overall richness and abundance of reptiles and amphibians than either palmito or pasture; palmito supported greater species richness and abundance of herpetofauna than pastures. Assemblages of reptiles and amphibians in palmito also exhibited greater similarity to those found in forests than did assemblages in pasture, particularly for reptiles. Species exhibited distinctive responses to forest-land use ecotones, with some species reaching their highest abundances in non-forest habitat. Our results show that two important land uses in Costa Rica differ in their capacity to buffer forest patches and promote landscape connectivity for reptile and amphibian populations. Understanding these differences is crucial for identifying matrix environments that can complement the natural forest habitats of sensitive reptile and amphibian species. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Aim: Species distributions are one of the most important ways to understand how communities interact through macroecological relationships. The functional abilities of a species, such as its plasticity in various environments, can determine its distribution, species richness and beta diversity patterns. In this study, we evaluate how functional traits influence the distribution of amphibians, and hypothesize which functional traits explain the current pattern of amphibian species composition. Location: Atlantic Forest, Brazil. Taxon: Amphibia (Anura and Gymnophiona). Methods: Using potential distributions of Brazilian amphibians from Atlantic Forest based on their functional traits, we analysed the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on species richness, endemism (with permutation multivariate analysis) and beta diversity components (i.e. total, turnover and nestedness dissimilarities). Results: Environmental variables explained 59.5% of species richness, whereas functional traits explained 15.8% of species distribution (geographical species range) for Anuran and 88.8% for Gymnophiona. Body size had the strongest correlation with species distribution. Results showed that species with medium to large body size, and species that are adapted to living in open areas tended to disperse from west to east direction. Current forest changes directly affected beta diversity patterns (i.e. most species adapted to novel environments increase their ranges). Beta diversity partitioning between humid and dry forests showed decreased nestedness and increased turnover by increasing altitude in the south-eastern region of the Atlantic Forest. Main Conclusions: Our study shows that functional traits directly influence the ability of the species to disperse. With the alterations of the natural environment, species more apt to these alterations have dispersed or increased their distribution, which consequently changes community structure. As a result, there are nested species distribution patterns and homogenization of amphibian species composition throughout the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.},

The study of sound in landscapes is based on an understanding of how sound, from various sources-biological, geophysical and anthropogenic-can be used to understand coupled natural-human dynamics across different spatial and temporal scales. Useful terms, such as soundscapes, biophony, geophony and anthrophony, are introduced and defined. The intellectual foundations of soundscape ecology are described-those of spatial ecology, bioacoustics, urban environmental acoustics and acoustic ecology. We argue that soundscape ecology differs from the humanities driven focus of acoustic ecology although soundscape ecology will likely need its rich vocabulary and conservation ethic. An integrative framework is presented that describes how climate, land transformations, biodiversity patterns, timing of life history events and human activities create the dynamic soundscape. We also summarize what is currently known about factors that control temporal soundscape dynamics and variability across spatial gradients. Several different phonic interactions (e. g., how anthrophony affects biophony) are also described. Soundscape ecology tools that will be needed are also discussed along with the several ways in which soundscapes need to be managed.

The frog Allobates femoralis has been regarded as a pan-Amazonian species, and widely used as a model for addressing evolutionary issues regarding patterns of intraspecific diversification, social organisation, and animal communication. Recent accumulation of genetic, morphological, and bioacoustic data gathered from different localities strongly supports the idea that it represents a species complex, but field behavioural observations related to courtship and mating are surprisingly scarce. Here, we provide a description of several aspects of the reproductive biology of A. femoralis from a Central Amazon site, and compare our results with the few published reports for the species. This study demonstrated that, besides the known divergence in the number of notes of the A. femoralis call, there are both quantitative and qualitative differences regarding reproductive traits between two populations of this taxon. The most striking difference was the observation of cephalic amplexus in the population from the Reserva Ducke, Brazil, which contrasts with the absence of any kind of body contact between A. femoralis pairs during mating interactions at the Panguana Biological Station, Peru. In addition, we report for the first time a set of visual components of the courtship behaviour, such as throat display, limb lifting, circling, and leg stretching. Behavioural differences can lead to a pre-zygotic isolation, thus representing a first step in the speciation process through differential sexual preferences. Hence, our finding of divergence in a set of traits probably related to mate recognition and choice is surprising within populations assigned to a single clade, and highlights the importance of considering behavioural traits in order to disentangle the evolutionary forces driving the diversification of A. femoralis. © 2011 Dipartimento di Biologia Evoluzionistica dell'Università, Firenze, Italia.},

Constructing buildings, bridges, or motorways over water reservoirs is perilous for resident amphibians, which belong to one of the most fragile animal groups. An automated system that reliably identifies whether any amphibian species live in a water reservoir before construction in that region will help building inspectors during city planning and will ensure that citizens can enjoy the opportunities provided by nature. In this paper, an intelligent amphibian species detection system is developed using features extracted from GIS and satellite images. The presence of seven amphibian species is detected using an artificial neural network (ANN). Depending on the spatial features of the region, the proposed cascade-forward backpropagation neural network (CFBNN) model, a special type of ANN, determines which amphibian species live there to enable ecological precautions to be taken before construction starts and to preserve the biodiversity for the future health of the community. The results clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms recently suggested strategies with more than 15% improvement on average. The performance of the system shows that the proposed detection approach can be a useful tool for smart and ecological city planning.},

Given the importance of PVAs, it is essential that they be rigorous and adhere to widely accepted guidelines; however, the quality of published PVAs is rarely assessed. We evaluated the quality of 160 PVAs of 144 species of birds and mammals published in peer-reviewed journals from 1990 to 2017. We hypothesized that PVA quality would be lower with generic programs than with custom-built programs; be higher for those developed for imperiled species; change over time; and be higher for those published in journals with high impact factors (IFs). Each included study was evaluated based on answers to an evaluation framework containing 32 questions reflecting whether and to what extent the PVA study adhered to published PVA guidelines or contained important PVA components. All measures of PVA quality were generally lower for studies based on generic programs. Conservation status of the species did not affect any measure of PVA quality, but PVAs published in high IF journals were of higher quality. Quality generally declined over time, suggesting the quantitative literacy of PVA practitioners has not increased over time or that PVAs developed by unskilled users are being published in peer-reviewed journals. Only 18.1% of studies were of high quality (score >75%), which is troubling because poor-quality PVAs could misinform conservation decisions. We call for increased scrutiny of PVAs by journal editors and reviewers. Our evaluation framework can be used for this purpose. Because poor-quality PVAs continue to be published, we recommend caution while using PVA results in conservation decision making without thoroughly assessing the PVA quality.},

Biota Neotrop., 8(3): http://www.biotaneotropica.org.br/v8n3/en/abstract?point-of-view+bn00108032008. Abstract: In Community Ecology and in many applications of Conservation Biology, diversity means variety of species, which may or not include information on the relative importance of each species. Diversity is one of the most important attributes in the study of communities and, as a result, many methods are available to its measurement. Among them, non-parametric diversity (or heterogeneity) indices such as Shannon and Simpson formulae are widely employed in a range of studies. These indices are composed of (or confound) two components, species richness and evenness. Different indices can be obtained combining the two components with different weights. The lack of an objective criteria to guide appropriate weighting of each component results in an arbitrary decision to use an index and not another. Additionally, depending on the weight the indices give to each component, an index may indicate that community A is more diversified than community B while a second index may indicate the contrary. Also, diversity indices applied to samples differing in species richness and evenness may produce similar values. Such problems can be avoided using alternative methods. One of them is diversity profile, which includes not one index but many diversity indices differing in the weight given to each component. Additional alternatives include the use of species richness only, Whittaker's diagram (or of dominance) and scatter diagrams with axes defined by species richness and an evenness index. Except by species richness, the cited alternative methods show graphically much more information than that contained in a single value produced by a diversity index. In studies requiring a response variable to be modeled in relation to predictor variables (Linear Models such as Regression and Analysis of Variance), I suggest the separate use of species richness and evenness as each one may reflect different aspect of communities.

O que ganhamos 'confundindo' riqueza de espécies e equabilidade em um índice de diversidade? Biota Neotrop., 8(3): http://www.biotaneotropica.org.br/v8n3/pt/abstract?point-of-view+bn00108032008. Resumo: No contexto de Ecologia de Comunidades e em várias aplicações da Biologia da Conservação, diversidade indica variedade de espécies, podendo ou não incluir informações sobre a importância relativa de cada espécie. Diversidade é um dos atributos mais fundamentais no estudo de comunidades e para tal uma ampla gama de métodos para sua mensuração estão disponíveis. Entre eles destacam-se, pelo amplo uso, índices de diversidade não-paramétricos (ou de heterogeneidade) tais como os Índices de Shannon e Simpson. Estes índices consistem de (ou confundem) dois componentes, riqueza de espécies e equabilidade. Diferentes índices de diversidade podem ser obtidos combinando-se com diferentes pesos estes dois componentes. Dada a ausência de um critério objetivo na escolha destes pesos, o uso de um índice em detrimento de outro é muitas vezes arbitrário. Adicionalmente, visto o peso dado por cada índice de diversidade para cada um dos dois componentes, um dado índice pode indicar que a amostra A é mais diversa que a B, enquanto um outro índice pode indicar o contrário. Ainda, índices de diversidade aplicados sobre amostras diferindo em riqueza de espécies e equabilidade podem produzir o mesmo valor. Tais problemas podem ser contornados utilizando-se métodos alternativos. Um destes consiste no cálculo de perfis de diversidade, em que se calcula não apenas um mas vários índices de diversidade diferindo no peso dado a cada um dos componentes. Outras alternativas incluem o uso de riqueza de espécies apenas, diagrama de Whittaker (ou de dominância) e diagramas de dispersão com eixos definidos por riqueza de espécies e um índice de equabilidade. Com exceção de riqueza de espécies, as demais alternativas citadas mostram de forma gráfica muito mais informações do que aquela embutida num único valor obtido pela aplicação de um índice de diversidade. No caso de estudos em que se necessita de um valor resposta, a ser modelado segundo um ou mais preditores (Modelos Lineares tais como Regressão e Análise de Variância), uma sugestão é o uso separado de riqueza de espécies e de equabilidade.

In response to anticipated effects of climate change, conservation organizations and government agencies are developing "adaptation strategies" to facilitate the adjustment of human society and ecological systems to altered climate regimes. We reviewed the literature and climate-change adaptation plans that have been developed in United States, Canada, England, México, and South Africa and found 16 general adaptation strategies that relate directly to the conservation of biological diversity. These strategies can be grouped into four broad categories: land and water protection and management; direct species management; monitoring and planning; and law and policy. Tools for implementing these strategies are similar or identical to those already in use by conservationists worldwide (land and water conservation, ecological restoration, agrienvironment schemes, species translocation, captive propagation, monitoring, natural resource planning, and legislation/regulation). Although our review indicates natural resource managers already have many tools that can be used to address climate-change effects, managers will likely need to apply these tools in novel and innovative ways to meet the unprecedented challenges posed by climate change. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease that kills an estimated 81,000 to 138,000 people and disables another 400,000 globally every year. The World Health Organization aims to halve this burden by 2030. To achieve this ambitious goal, we need to close the data gap in snake ecology and snakebite epidemiology and give healthcare providers up-to-date knowledge and access to better diagnostic tools. An essential first step is to improve the capacity to identify biting snakes taxonomically. The existence of AI-based identification tools for other animals offers an innovative opportunity to apply machine learning to snake identification and snakebite envenoming, a life-threatening situation. METHODOLOGY: We developed an AI model based on Vision Transformer, a recent neural network architecture, and a comprehensive snake photo dataset of 386,006 training photos covering 198 venomous and 574 non-venomous snake species from 188 countries. We gathered photos from online biodiversity platforms (iNaturalist and HerpMapper) and a photo-sharing site (Flickr). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The model macro-averaged F1 score, which reflects the species-wise performance as averaging performance for each species, is 92.2%. The accuracy on a species and genus level is 96.0% and 99.0%, respectively. The average accuracy per country is 94.2%. The model accurately classifies selected venomous and non-venomous lookalike species from Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this model's taxonomic and geographic coverage and performance are unprecedented. This model could provide high-speed and low-cost snake identification to support snakebite victims and healthcare providers in low-resource settings, as well as zoologists, conservationists, and nature lovers from across the world.},

In response to this challenge, this paper presents a conceptual framework and typology for describing, classifying and valuing ecosystem functions, goods and services in a clear and consistent manner. In the following analysis, a classification is given for the fullest possible range of 23 ecosystem functions that provide a much larger number of goods and services.

   abstract = {Species richness and abundance, as well as trophic relationships, are affected by habitat configuration. Smaller habitat patches suffer greater external interference, being more susceptible to diversity loss and could also receive more trophic subsidies from outside or matrix, which can favour the maintenance of populations even in small patches. Natural mosaics of forest patches in a grassland matrix in southern Brazil are good places to analyse such a process. Our objective was to analyse the effect of habitat patching on trophic relationships based on the evaluation of two forest amphibian species (Physalaemus lisei and P. carrizorum) and compare those from habitat patches versus core/contiguous habitat. We compared isotopic carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen ratios (δ15N) in two anuran species as well the variation in their diet at different forest patch sizes. We chose carbon isotopes since they act as a proxy for inferences on the original habitat from which the matter flows towards the anurans, while nitrogen reveals their tropic level. Our results revealed that trophic sources for these amphibians derives predominantly from primary forest productivity. However, Physalaemus lisei δ13C values indicated that the contribution of grassland trophic sources in the diet was higher in frogs from forests patches (<100 ha) than in those from core forest habitat. In smaller patches, P. lisei consumed predominantly ants, which was the most abundant prey on habitat. On the other hand, in the core forest, where isopods were the most abundant prey, most of its consumption was beetles, spiders and ants. In contrast, P. carrizorum showed no significant changes in isotopic ratios or diet across habitats. Isotopic data suggested that both species occupied lower trophic levels in smaller forests than in core forests. Our data showed a tendency towards the increase of grassland contribution and decrease of amphibian trophic position in patched habitats in comparison to continuous habitat.},

   abstract = {Extinctions of anuran amphibians are more alarming compared to all other vertebrates. Several reports of declines come from Atlantic Forest, which currently holds only 1.62% of natural vegetation under full protection. However, despite this degradation, the Atlantic Forest still shelters a great diversity of anurans with a high diversity of specific ecological characteristics. Thus, our objective was to identify which ecological characteristics of anurans from the Atlantic Forest can be associated to this extinction risk, in order to understand how these characteristics can promote the species persistence against environmental disturbance. For each species, we gathered biological/ecological characteristics from literature, as well the extinction risk based on the National List of Endangered Species of Wildlife. In 2015, 547 anuran species had been assigned to the Atlantic Forest, of which 406 had their extinction risk defined. However, we considered only 295 species in our analyses due to the availability of biological/ecological information. We observed that the clutch size and the altitudinal distribution are related to the extinction risk of anurans. Threatened species had a small clutch size and were distributed in low or high areas, whereas non-threatened species had a larger clutch size and were distributed in intermediate altitude areas. Studies that investigate ecological characteristics that determine the extinction risk of species can be useful to assist conservation actions, concentrating efforts to species more sensitive to environmental alterations, besides highlighting the importance of natural history and the ecology of organisms in conservation decisions.},

We tested the utilitarian redundancy model (as an analogy to the ecological redundancy hypothesis) in evaluating the implications of the use of medicinal plants by rural communities to examine whether the presence of numerous species with analogous functions (identical therapeutic applications, for example) would reduce the use-impact on native species in the neighboring caatinga vegetation. Various techniques were used to collect information concerning medicinal plants and their applications from 19 residents considered "local specialists". The vegetation was sampled to determine the abundance of woody plants. Approximately 106 plants that fall into 67 local therapeutic categories were identified. Despite the fact that exotic species compose a significant fraction of the local medicinal flora, the native species represented the greatest percentage of local uses and indications. Amburana cearensis, Myracrodruon urundeuva, Anadenanthera colubrina, Sideroxylon obtusifolium, and Ziziphus joazeiro, for example, are highly sought after plants, and represent key species in terms of conservation and sustainable management.

The study goal was to evaluate domestic cat predation in a Neotropical city. We intend to answer the following questions: (1) Which is the richness, dominance and abundance of prey captured by domestic cats? (2) Which are the extrinsic or intrinsic factors that most influence prey capture by domestic cats? We predict that: (a) cats will capture a large diversity of native wildlife and (b) extrinsic factors will have a greater effect compared intrinsic factors due to the innate predatory cat’s behavior. We chose 120 cats from 44 households in the city of Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico. We documented the richness, dominance and abundance of wildlife species captured and brought home by cats during March to August 2019 and those intrinsic and extrinsic factors that modulate their predatory behavior. The cats captured 246 prey items, 35.8% were reptiles, 23.2% invertebrates, 17.9% amphibians, 15.4% birds and 7.7% mammals. The prey items belonged to 64 taxa (17 birds, 17 invertebrates, 15 reptiles, nine mammals and six amphibians). The lizard Sceloporus variabilis was the most captured prey. Of the prey items, 93.5% were native and 6.5% non-native. Five intrinsic and 5 extrinsic factors contributed most to the predation events, of which cat stripe color, time spent by the cats outside of the home and nocturnal confinement were the most important.

We use spatial analyses of community dissimilarity to generate hypotheses about the current and historical processes underlying patterns of beta diversity in anuran species in the Brazilian Cerrado. Specifically, we use a generalized dissimilarity modeling (GDM) approach to model compositional dissimilarity of anuran species and endemics as a function of geographic separation and local (within-Cerrado) environmental conditions. To gain insight about potential historical processes, we incorporate information from biomes adjacent to the Cerrado to investigate whether environmental conditions in neighboring areas can help explain patterns of beta diversity within the Cerrado. Patterns of anuran beta diversity of both endemics and all species in the Cerrado appear to be strongly influenced by local environmental gradients, with elevation as one of the most important variables in all models. However, in models using endemic species only, environmental conditions of adjacent biomes were related to beta-diversity patterns, and more strongly so, than to total species models. These results suggest that phylogenetic niche conservatism within species groups that invaded the Cerrado from adjacent biomes may cause these species to be restricted to environmental conditions within the Cerrado that are most similar to the conditions in the adjacent biome where they originated. Time-calibrated phylogenies of Cerrado endemics and studies of ancestral and current ranges of Cerrado species are needed to test this hypothesis. © 2012 The Authors.},

For example, a weak treatment of collinearities might lead to discarding important variables for the model, and this can be avoided by a correct approach to collinearities before the model selection. Moreover, studies have demonstrated that the spatial structure in both predictor and response variables is an important point to be addressed, rather than the presence of this structure only in the residuals. Aiming to facilitate the controlling of such bias, I provide two fully explained scripts for R language.

Examples from population and landscape ecology are used to illustrate the usefulness of fractal geometry to the field of ecology. The advent of the computer age played an important role in the development and acceptance of fractal geometry as a valid new discipline. New insights gained from the application of fractal geometry to ecology include: understanding the importance of spatial and temporal scales; the relationship between landscape structure and movement pathways; an increased understanding of landscape structures; and the ability to more accurately model landscapes and ecosystems. Using fractal dimensions allows ecologists to map animal pathways without creating an unmanageable deluge of information. Computer simulations of landscapes provide useful models for gaining new insights into the coexistence of species. Although many ecologists have found fractal geometry to be an extremely useful tool, not all concur. With all the new insights gained through the appropriate application of fractal geometry to natural sciences, it is clear that fractal geometry a useful and valid tool. New insight into the natural world is just one of the results of the increasing popularity and use of fractal geometry in the last decade. What are fractals and what are they good for? Scientists in a variety of disciplines have been trying to answer this question for the last two decades. Physicists, chemists, mathematicians, biologists, computer scientists, and medical researchers are just a few of the scientists that have found uses for fractals and fractal geometry. Ecologists have found fractal geometry to be an extremely useful tool for describing ecological systems. Many population, community, ecosystem, and landscape ecologists use fractal geometry as a tool to help define and explain the systems in the world around us. As with any scientific field, there has been some dissension in ecology about the appropriate level of study. For example, some organism ecologists think that anything larger than a single organism obscures the reality with too much detail. On the other hand, some ecosystem ecologists believe that looking at anything less than an entire ecosystem will not give meaningful results. In reality, both perspectives are correct. Ecologists must take all levels of organization into account to get the most out of a study. Fractal geometry is a tool that bridges the "gap" between different fields of ecology and provides a common language. Fractal geometry has provided new insight into many fields of ecology. Examples from population and landscape ecology will be used to illustrate the usefulness of fractal geometry to the field of ecology. Some population ecologists use fractal geometry to correlate the landscape structure with movement pathways of populations or organisms, which greatly influences population and community ecology. Landscape ecologists tend to use fractal geometry to define, describe, and model the scale-dependent heterogeneity of the landscape structure. Before exploring applications of fractal geometry in ecology, we must first define fractal},

   abstract = {Population Viability Analysis (PVA) is the estimation of extinction probabilities by analyses that incorporate identifiable threats to population survival into models of the extinction process. Extrinsic forces, such as habitat loss, over-harvesting, and competition or predation by introduced species, often lead to population decline. Although the traditional methods of wildlife ecology can reveal such deterministic trends, random fluctuations that increase as populations become smaller can lead to extinction even of populations that have, on average, positive population growth when below carrying capacity. Computer simulation modelling provides a tool for exploring the viability of populations subjected to many complex, interacting deterministic and random processes. One such simulation model, VORTEX, has been used extensively by the Captive Breeding Specialist Group (Species Survival Commission, IUCN), by wildlife agencies, and by university classes. The algorithms, structure, assumptions and applications of VORTEX are described in this paper. VORTEX models population processes as discrete, sequential events, with probabilistic outcomes. VORTEX simulates birth and death processes and the transmission of genes through the generations by generating random numbers to determine whether each animal lives or dies, to determine the number of progeny produced by each female each year, and to determine which of the two alleles at a genetic locus are transmitted from each parent to each offspring. Fecundity is assumed to be independent of age after an animal reaches reproductive age. Mortality rates are specified for each pre-reproductive age-sex class and for reproductive-age animals. Inbreeding depression is modelled as a decrease in viability in inbred animals. The user has the option of modelling density dependence in reproductive rates. As a simple model of density dependence in survival, a carrying capacity is imposed by a probabilistic truncation of each age class if the population size exceeds the specified carrying capacity. VORTEX can model linear trends in the carrying capacity. VORTEX models environmental variation by sampling birth rates, death rates, and the carrying capacity from binomial or normal distributions. Catastrophes are modelled as sporadic random events that reduce survival and reproduction for one year. VORTEX also allows the user to supplement or harvest the population, and multiple subpopulations can be tracked, with user-specified migration among the units. VORTEX outputs summary statistics on population growth rates, the probability of population extinction, the time to extinction, and the mean size and genetic variation in extant populations. VORTEX necessarily makes many assumptions. The model it incorporates is most applicable to species with low fecundity and long lifespans, such as mammals, birds and reptiles. It integrates the interacting effects of many of the deterministic and stochastic processes that have an impact on the viability of small populations, providing opportunity for more complete analysis than is possible by other techniques. PVA by simulation modelling is an important tool for identifying populations at risk of extinction, determining the urgency of action, and evaluating options for management.},

We propose that ecological resilience is generated by diverse, but overlapping , function within a scale and by apparently redundant species that operate at different scales, thereby reinforcing function across scales. The distribution of functional diversity within and across scales enables regeneration and renewal to occur following ecological disruption over a wide range of scales.},

   abstract = {This paper considers the central tenet of the 'Econet Initiative' and the developing view of the structure and function of ecosystems and their essential emergence from ecological interactions at the level of individuals and populations. Most of what we consider to be community ecology is concerned with how individuals and species-specific populations respond to, smooth, or fail to accommodate, the consequences of inhabiting continuously variable environments. The essential principle is that individuals, populations, communities, systems, each build towards a definable, contemporaneous, habitat-specific supportive capacity, set by the resource base and the opportunities to process them. While both are amenable, interspecific competition is weak and many species may have the chance to raise their recruitment potential and build biomass, with the dynamic advantage going to the most efficient converters at every trophic level (r-vs. K-selection). As a result of the biomass expansion or of the independent diminution in opportunity or resource base, the special adaptations of disturbance-(R) or stress-(S) tolerant species allow them to glean survival under increasingly competitive strains. Persistent variability and renewal of growth opportunities make exclusion difficult and extinction is more a local than a regional consequence. Poorly competitive species survive through an ability to find new habitat patches 'released' by variability. Integration to larger geographical patterns gives the linkage to higher-order ecosystem behaviour. Some examples of contemporary ecological issues (latitude gradients, optimality, threshold behaviour and the maintenance of biodiversity) are reviewed in the context of systems behaviour.},

   abstract = {Given current deforestation and land-use change in species-rich tropical forests, a pressing need in conservation biology is to understand how converted, human-modified landscapes support biodiversity. Here, we measured the species richness, abundance, and community composition of amphibians and reptiles in reference primary forest and mono-dominant plantations of three native tree species (Pentaclethra macroloba, Virola koschnyi, Vochysia guatemalensis) at La Selva Biological Station in the Caribbean lowlands of northern Costa Rica. Because these plantation species generate markedly different forest-floor habitats, we hypothesized that tree species would support different assemblages of leaf-litter herpetofauna. Primary forest, Virola, and Vochysia supported greater richness of frogs than Pentaclethra. Frog densities were significantly lower in Pentaclethra and Vochysia than in nearby primary forest. Using non-metric multidimensional scaling and permutational multivariate analysis of variance, we found Pentaclethra to support significantly different assemblages of frogs and lizards than primary forest reference sites, while Vochysia supported a unique assemblage of frogs. Our results suggest that some tree species plantations can support herpetofaunal assemblages comparable to primary forest in richness, community assembly, and abundance. While herpetofaunal community ecology varies among plantation species, our study provides a compelling example of how plantation landscapes can facilitate the restoration of native fauna on degraded landscapes.},

   abstract = {The Atlantic Rainforest originally covered much of the Brazilian coast and is now reduced to approximately only 7% of its original area. Data on abundance distribution and microhabitat characteristics of anuran amphibians living on the forest floor leaf litter in the Atlantic Rainforest are scarce. In this study, we analysed the effect of litter depth and structure on the abundance and species richness of leaf-litter frogs in an area of Atlantic Rainforest at Ilha Grande, Rio de Janeiro State, south-eastern Brazil. We performed monthly samples (nocturnal and diurnal) from August 1996 to October 1997 using small (2 m × 1 m) plots. We sampled 234 plots, totalling 468 m2 of forest leaf litter. We estimated leaf-litter depth and the proportion of leaves in the plot and tested their effect on the total abundance of frogs and species richness using multiple regression analysis. We found 185 frogs from eight species: Brachycephalus (=Psyllophryne) didactylus (Izecksohn, 1971) (Brachycephalidae), Dendrophryniscus brevipollicatus Jiménez de la Espada 1871 (Bufonidae), Adenomera marmorata Steindachner 1867, Eleutherodactylus parvus (Girard 1853), Eleutherodactylus guentheri (Steindachner 1864), Eleutherodactylus binotatus (Spix 1824) and Zachaenus parvulus (Girard 1853) (Leptodactylidae), and Chiasmocleis sp. (Microhylidae). Brachycephalus didactylus was the most abundant species, with 91 individuals, whereas Dendrophryniscus brevipollicatus was the rarest, with two individuals. Mean litter depth and the proportion of leaves in the leaf litter were significantly related to frog abundance (R2 = 0.17; F2,107 = 10.779; P = 0.0001) and species richness (R2 = 0.11; F2,107 = 6.375; P = 0.002) indicating that microhabitat characteristics may affect local distribution and abundance of frogs in the forest floor. © 2007 Ecological Society of Australia.},

   abstract = {We examined patterns of community structure and microhabitat requirements of Pristimantis frogs at sites of high geographic proximity in the Tambopata region of southeastern Peru. Herpetofaunal surveys were conducted at five sites encompassing approximately 131 square km of Tambopata Province, including EcoAmazonía (EA), Réserva Amazónica (RA), Explorer's Inn (El), Sachavacayoc Centre (SC), and Tambopata Research Center (TRC). In addition to sampling and identifying all species of Pristimantis captured, environmental variables, including substrate, perch height, leaf litter depth, tree cover, and time of day, were collected and analyzed. Total frog encounters, species richness, diversity, and community similarity differed significantly among sites. Generally, similarity, richness, and diversity were not closely related to geographic proximity, but total abundance was. More individuals were captured at SC and TRC, whereas more total species were captured at TRC and El. Diversity was the highest at TRC, followed by RA, El, EA, and SC. Encounters of P. toftae and P. peruvianus also differed significantly among sites, with one species rarely encountered where the other was prevalent. Generally, more individuals of Pristimantis were captured during the wet season at all five sites. Significantly more individuals were captured during the night than the day. Significantly more individuals as well as species were captured on leaves and the ground versus all other substrate types, with more on leaves at night and on the ground during the day. Significantly more adults were captured higher off the ground than juveniles, with males found higher than females. There was no significant relationship between frog encounters and leaf litter or tree cover. Pristimantis peruvianus was shown to exhibit differences in microhabitat usage from P. toftae. We conclude that many factors contribute to the observed differences in diversity among the sites, requiring future studies that will also examine other environmental variables such as forest type, soil characteristics, and prey availability. © 2009 by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists.},

The effect of habitat structure on species of Pristimantis in a bamboo-dominated remnant forest located in southwestern Amazonia is analyzed herein. Active visual and auditory searches in 10 plots of the Biodiversity Research Program (PPBio) were conducted between November 2012 and May 2013. Four hundred and sixty individuals of five species were recorded. Pristimantis altamazonicus, P. diadematus, P. fenestratus, P. reichlei, and P. skydmainus. Neither spatial distance nor the structure of the habitat of the plots affected the composition of Pristimantis. This first axis of PCA explained 45.6% variation of the characterization habitat structure, correctly significantly with the number of Pristimantis, species increasing with trees between 10 ≤ dbh < 30cm and decreased with density of bamboo. The increase in litter depth and canopy cover influenced in the occurrence of P. reichlie, the occurrence of P. skydmainus decreased with cm and the occurrence of P. diadematus decreased relative to increased canopy cover. Pristimantis diadematus and P. skydmainus were the most restricted species in terms of habitat and were especially susceptible to bamboo density.},

   abstract = {Aim: We analysed elevational and microclimatic drivers of thermal tolerance diversity in a tropical mountain frog clade to test three macrophysiological predictions: less spatial variation in upper than lower thermal limits (Bretts’ heat-invariant hypothesis); narrower thermal tolerance ranges in habitats with less variation in temperature (Janzen's climatic variability hypothesis); and higher level of heat impacts at lower elevations. Location: Forest and open habitats through a 4,230-m elevational gradient across the tropical Andes of Ecuador. Method: We examined variability in critical thermal limits (CTmax and CTmin) and thermal breadth (TB; CTmax–CTmin) in 21 species of Pristimantis frogs. Additionally, we monitored maximum and minimum temperatures at the local scale (tmax, tmin) and estimated vulnerability to acute thermal stress from heat (CTmax–tmax) and cold (tmin–CTmin), by partitioning thermal diversity into elevational and microclimatic variation. Results: Our results were consistent with Brett's hypothesis: elevation promotes more variation in CTmin and tmin than in CTmax and tmax. Frogs inhabiting thermally variable open habitats have higher CTmax and tmax and greater TBs than species restricted to forest habitats, which show less climatic overlap across the elevational gradient (Janzen's hypothesis). Vulnerability to heat stress was higher in open than forest habitats and did not vary with elevation. Main conclusions: We suggest a mechanistic explanation of thermal tolerance diversity in elevational gradients by including microclimatic thermal variation. We propose that the unfeasibility to buffer minimum temperatures locally may explain the rapid increase in cold tolerance (lower CTmin) with elevation. In contrast, the relative invariability in heat tolerance (CTmax) with elevation may revolve around the organisms’ habitat selection of open- and canopy-buffered habitats. Secondly, on the basis of microclimatic estimates, lowland and upland species may be equally vulnerable to temperature increase, which is contrary to the pattern inferred from regional interpolated climate estimators.},

They contain valuable timber species but are threatened by farming and mining activities. The objective of this study was to describe canopy opening and light relations in two seasonally deciduous dry forests on slopes and limestone outcrops, in the Paranã valley at the northeastern region of the Goiás state, Brazil. The studied forests were in the Fazenda Sabonete in Iaciara-Go and Fazenda Forquilha in Guarani-GO. Woody plants were sampled in 25 (20 x 20 m) plots in each forest. In the Sabonete forest 40 species, 705 ind./ha-1 with a basal area of 15.78 m²/ha-1 were found, while in Forquilha there were 55 species, 956 ind./ha-1 with a basal area of 24.76 m²/ha-1. Using hemispherical photographic techniques, 25 black and white photographs were taken at each site, during the dry season, totaling 50 photographs. These were taken at the beginning of each vegetation-sampling plot. The photographs were scanned in grey tones and saved as 'Bitmap'. The canopy opening and leaf area index (LAI) were calculated using the software Winphot. The mean canopy opening was 54.0% (±9.36) for Fazenda Sabonete and 64.6% (±11.8) in Fazenda Forquilha, with both sites presenting significant differences in the opening estimates (P &lt; 0.05). Their floristic richness and structure also differed with the more open canopy forest, Forquilha, being richer and denser, suggesting the need for further studies on species-environment relationships in these forests.</p>},

   abstract = {Hemispherical photography is a relevant tool to estimate canopy attributes such as leaf area index (LAI). Advancements in digital photography and image processing tools have supported long-lasting use of digital hemispherical photography (DHP). While some open-source tools exists for DHP, very few solutions have been made available in R programming packages, and none of these allows a full processing workflow to retrieve LAI and other canopy attributes from fisheye images.

To fill this gap, we developed an R package (hemispheR) to support the whole processing of DHP images in an automated, fast, and reproducible way. The package functions, which are designed for step-by-step single-image analysis, can be performed sequentially in a pipeline, while allowing inspecting the quality of each image processing step. The package allows to analyze both circular and fullframe fisheye images, collected either with upward facing (forest canopies) or downward facing (short canopies and crops) camera orientation. In addition, the package allows to implement two consolidated LAI methods (LAI-2000/2200 and 57° method).

A case study is presented to demonstrate the reliability of canopy attributes derived from hemispheR in temperate deciduous forests with variable canopy density and structure. Canopy attributes were validated against either results obtained from a reference proprietary software, either by benchmarking plot-level LAI with measurements obtained from littertraps. Results indicated hemispheR provide reliable openness and leaf area index in forest canopies as compared with reference values. We also found that combining hemispheR with other R packages further advance analysis of hemispherical canopy images, by reducing the sensitivity of results to camera exposure in both raw and non-raw canopy imagery.

By providing a simple, transparent, and flexible image processing procedure, hemispheR supported the use of DHP for routine measurements and monitoring of forest canopy attributes. Hosting the package in a Git repository can further support development of the package, through either collaborative coding or forking projects.},

   abstract = {The crowns of trees and shrubs often overtop temporary wetlands in forested regions. By shading pond basins, canopy can dramatically change the conditions experienced by residents such as amphibians. In this study, we estimated the presence of 8 amphibian species across 17 temporary wetlands at the Yale-Myers Forest in northeastern Connecticut, USA. In addition, we quantified the light environment using a grid of hemispherical canopy photographs to calculate Global Site Factor (GSF) within each wetland. Amphibian richness was low in most wetlands, and most wetlands were relatively shaded. Amphibian richness increased in lighter wetlands. This result was not confounded by relationships with wetland size. Most amphibian species tended to be absent from heavily shaded wetlands ('open canopy specialists'). However, three species were often found in the shadiest wetlands ('canopy generalists'). Field transplant experiments using one canopy generalist and one open canopy specialist showed that development of the generalist was less affected by wetland light levels compared with performance of the specialist. These findings suggest that canopy may be an important determinant of amphibian diversity patterns across wetlands. Further, conservation strategies dependent on universally applied, inviolate shoreline vegetation buffers may inadvertently contribute to species loss. Because species differ in their sensitivity to changes in canopy, these losses may be predictable. © Springer 2005.},

   abstract = {Little is known about the effects of anthropogenic land-use change on the amphibians and reptiles of the biodiverse tropical forests of Southeast Asia. We studied a land-use modification gradient stretching from primary forest, secondary forest, natural-shade cacao agroforest, planted-shade cacao agroforest to open areas in central Sulawesi, Indonesia. We determined species richness, abundance, turnover, and community composition in all habitat types and related these to environmental correlates, such as canopy heterogeneity and thickness of leaf litter. Amphibian species richness decreased systematically along the land-use modification gradient, but reptile richness and abundance peaked in natural-shade cacao agroforests. Species richness and abundance patterns across the disturbance gradient were best explained by canopy cover and leaf-litter thickness in amphibians and by canopy heterogeneity and cover in reptiles. Amphibians were more severely affected by forest disturbance in Sulawesi than reptiles. Heterogeneous canopy cover and thick leaf litter should be maintained in cacao plantations to facilitate the conservation value for both groups. For long-term and sustainable use of plantations, pruned shade trees should be permanently kept to allow rejuvenation of cacao and, thus, to prevent repeated forest encroachment. © 2010 Society for Conservation Biology.},

   abstract = {Hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons are common disturbances in many island and coastal forests. There is a lack of understanding of the importance to forest biota of the two major physical aspects that occur simultaneously during a hurricane: canopy disturbance and detritus (debris) deposition onto the ground. Using a replicated factorial design, our study involved experimentally determining the independent and interactive effects of canopy opening and debris additions to the forest floor on densities of coqui frogs (Eleutherodactylus coqui). Coquies are the dominant amphibian, and second most common vertebrate species, in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), a montane, tropical rainforest in northeastern Puerto Rico that frequently experiences hurricanes. Frogs were sampled in all twelve 30 × 30 m plots at three periods prior to installing treatments (July 2003, January 2004, July 2004), and at months 1, 3, 6, and 12 post-treatment. The degree of canopy opening and amount of debris deposited onto the forest floor by our experimental treatments closely mimicked conditions resulting from Hurricane Hugo, a severe hurricane that passed over the LEF in 1989. Based on findings from past studies involving natural hurricanes in the LEF, we predicted that coqui densities would increase in response to debris additions, and decrease or remain unchanged in response to canopy disturbance. However, we found that debris deposition had no significant effect on coqui density and that the opening of the canopy was the dominant aspect affecting coqui by significantly reducing their densities. We identified several possible explanations for the decreased coqui densities in open-canopy plots, including decreased litter moisture and insect prey, and temporal and spatial scales associated with disturbance that may have influenced coqui behavior. Following natural hurricanes, and in light of our findings from experimental hurricane impacts, we expect that coquies benefit from patches of intact canopy while suffering reduced densities in open-canopy settings. Furthermore, based on our study and other experimental forest studies involving frogs, future forest practices that remove significant canopy should probably be viewed as having an initially (up to 1 year) negative effect on the frog community.},

Permanent and natural aquatic habitats are relatively scarce in the Pantanal, and occurrence of temporary aquatic habitats varies seasonally, depending on rains. We here present results of evaluations of anuran's species richness and abundance in a seasonally flooded area in the northwestern section of the Pantanal (Fazenda Baía de Pedra, Cáceres municipality, state of Mato Grosso, Brazil), comparing values obtained in 10 plots systematically distributed over 5 km² with those obtained in additional aquatic plots in the study area. Data were obtained in five field trips, from February 2008 to March 2009. In addition to the plots, 36 water bodies (20 permanent and 16 temporary) were also sampled for the presence of anurans. In total, 3,983 individuals from 34 anuran species distributed in five families were recorded: Hylidae (14 species), Leptodactylidae (8), Leiuperidae (6), Microhylidae (4), and Bufonidae (2). Local richness represents 77.3% of the anuran diversity already recorded for the Brazilian Pantanal. The number of species recorded exclusively in systematically distributed terrestrial plots and in water bodies was 28 and 32, respectively. Sampling methods used at Fazenda Baía da Pedra were efficient in determining anuran richness, abundance, composition and distribution. Evaluations of anuran richness and abundance by using permanent sampling plots in the Pantanal may benefit from additional sampling sites, particularly permanent and temporary water bodies.</p>},

   abstract = {A unified framework to calculate biodiversity of ecological communities through Hill numbers (Hill, 1973; Jost, 2006) was recently proposed by Chao, Chiu, & Jost (2014). This
framework can be applied to three facets of biodiversity: taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity. These three facets of biodiversity can be expressed as Hill numbers
with the same units (effective number of species), facilitating direct comparisons between
them (Chao et al., 2014). In addition, this framework can account for species abundance
by changing the parameter q, which can be any non-negative number (e.g., 0, 0.99, 2). As
q increases, the diversity values become more sensitive to common species. When q = 0,
species abundance is ignored; q = 1, all species are weighted by their abundance equally
(i.e., Shannon’s diversity for taxonomic diversity); q = 2, common species get more weight
than rare species (i.e., inverse of Simpson diversity for taxonomic diversity). Furthermore,
both alpha and beta diversity can be calculated with this framework. Given the above
advantages, this framework has been adopted by an increasing number of researchers.
The R package hillR implements the framework proposed by Chao et al. (2014) and
makes it easy to calculate taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of ecological communities as Hill numbers. For each facet of diversity, hillR has three functions. The first set of functions (hill_taxa(), hill_func(), and hill_phylo()) calculates alpha diversity of each site. The second set of functions (hill_taxa_parti(),
hill_func_parti(), and hill_phylo_parti()) calculates diversity across all sites. The
third set of functions (hill_taxa_parti_pairwise(), hill_func_parti_pairwise(),
and hill_phylo_parti_pairwise()) calculates all possible pairwise diversity across all
sites. Users can set the argument q to control the weight of species abundance. For usage
examples of these functions, see the README file on Github.
The R package hillR is available on Github, where issues can be opened},

   abstract = {The replacement of native forests by high-density tree plantations affects the richness and composition of animal communities through the modification of the resource availability, hydrological regimes, nutrient cycles and soil structure. Previous studies have been conducted mainly on birds and mammals, whereas few have explored the response of anurans, a taxon considered at risk and in steep decline. With this study we aimed to evaluate changes in anuran diversity associated with native forest replacement by pine plantations (Pinus taeda) in the southern Atlantic forest of Argentina, a highly diverse and threatened ecosystem. Additionally, we intended to explore the role of the micro-habitat (terrestrial, aquatic) in the response. We characterized vegetation and habitat structure and sampled anurans in terrestrial and aquatic micro-habitats in the native forest and pine plantations monthly over two consecutive years (2012–2014), using three complementary techniques (pitfall traps, audio strip transects and larval sampling). A total of 964 individuals of 21 species were captured: Physalaemus cuvieri, Odontophrynus americanus and Elachistocleis bicolor were the most abundant species. Replacement of the structurally complex native forest by extremely simplified monoculture tree plantations influenced the patterns of anuran alpha and beta diversity. However, these changes were micro-habitat-dependent: changes in anuran diversity in the terrestrial habitat were explained by species loss, while those in the aquatic habitat were explained by both species loss and turnover. The arboreal species of the family Hylidae (eight) were found absent from tree plantations. Both the hydroperiod instability of the water bodies and the simplified vegetation structure of the tree plantations are probably limiting the suitability for both reproduction and larval development of some specialist species. The native vegetation surrounding the water bodies in the tree plantations constitutes a central element to maintain anuran diversity, through increasing the hydroperiod and providing a habitat for species reproduction in the southern Atlantic forest and to facilitate the movement of individuals among native forest remnants.},

Here, we update the knowledge regarding terrestrial vertebrates occurring in the Atlantic Forest, focusing on endemic species and presenting its main spatial patterns of diversity. We also analyzed the main knowledge gaps associated with these species. We identified 2,645 species of Tetrapoda in the Atlantic Forest, being 719 species of amphibians, 517 species of reptiles, 1,025 species of birds, and 384 species of mammals. The uniqueness of its fauna is impressive even in a global scale, as 2.8% of the world’s Tetrapoda species occurs only in the Atlantic Forest. For reptiles, this percentage is 1.3%, while for both birds and mammals, it hovers around 1.9%, but for amphibians, it reaches an impressive 6.6%. Spatially, most groups exhibit their highest species richness at the core of the Atlantic Forest, and this pattern becomes more evident when only endemic species are considered. Even with all its impressive diversity, 157 new Tetrapoda species were described in the Atlantic Forest in the last decade, mostly from poorly sampled regions or environments. An increase of sampling effort on these regions might increase the number of species on this biome, which already is one of the most diverse in the world.},

by the organization of Atlantic Forest biodiversity in collections (1890–1985); and

biodiversity, plant-animal interaction, and populations and community. The understanding of the distribution limits of the Atlantic Forest biome (11 different proposals), as well as sectorization (4 different proposals), has been the subject of several
studies and legislations, which are presented and discussed. Additionally, we present terminologies usually used to designate the Atlantic Forest as a whole, as well
as its sectors, to facilitate understanding in future studies. We conclude that understanding the Atlantic Forest remains a long and endless exercise, given its complexity, increased knowledge, and continuous threats.},

After five centuries of European human expansion, most Atlantic Forest landscapes are archipelagos of small forest fragments surrounded by open-habitat matrices. In this chapter, we describe the causes and consequences of large-scale defaunation in the Atlantic Forest of South America. We identify and quantify the magnitude of the main anthropogenic drivers of defaunation and stimulate a debate on how to revert the loss of fauna to restore biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services. The magnitude of the impact of defaunation in the Atlantic Forest is hard to estimate, but we can predict that, at large scale, habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation are the most common threats to terrestrial populations. Other threats vary in importance according to the taxonomic group. In general, apex predators, other carnivores, large-bodied mammals, and large herbivores were among the most defaunated functional groups and the loss of these animals has also a strong impact on the ecosystem services. Given the extent of the consequences of defaunation in the Atlantic Forest, mitigation strategies are imperative. Habitat restoration would clearly be effective in building space for defaunation mitigation but reversing the pervasive defaunation that occurred in the Atlantic Forest is by no means a straightforward task. Nonetheless, it will be fundamental to assure the persistence of the biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest remnants.},

Here we (i) explore the potential limitations and biases of both herbarium and inventory data, (ii) provide a synthesis of diversity patterns, and (iii) present a spatial prioritization, based on complementary scenarios, for sampling tree species across the domain. We show that despite the large amounts of herbarium data, the number of unique localities per species is rather small (median, 53) and data for most species is still scarce or not yet ready for use. The spatial patterns of both herbarium records and inventory data are influenced by the presence of protected areas, proportion of forest cover, distance to graduate programs, and variables representing ease of access. Species richness presented peaks in the mid-portion of the domain. Such a pattern is related to spatial and historical constraints, environmental variation, and influence from other phytogeographical domains.},

Recognising this, a group of scientists working on plant invasions in Latin America met in Chile in late 2010 to develop a research agenda for the region based on lessons learned elsewhere. Our three main findings are as follows. (1) Globalisation is inevitable, but the resultant plant introductions can be slowed or prevented by effective quarantine and early intervention. Development of spatially explicit inventories, research on the invasion process and weed risk assessments can help prioritise and streamline action. (2) Eradication has limited application for plants and control is expensive and requires strict prioritisation and careful planning and evaluation. (3) Accepting the concept of novel ecosystems, new combinations of native and introduced species that no longer depend on human intervention, may help optimise invasive species management. Our vision of novel ecosystem management is through actions that: (a) maintain as much native biodiversity and ecosystem functionality as possible, (b) minimise management intervention to invasives with known impact, and (c) maximise the area of intervention. We propose the creation of a Latin American Invasive Plants Network to help focus the new research agenda for member countries. The network would coordinate research and training and establish funding priorities, develop and strengthen tools to share knowledge, and raise awareness at the community, governmental and intergovernmental levels about the social, economic and environmental costs of plant invasions.},

The jackfruit tree Artocarpus heterophyllus, native from India and Bangladesh, has been cultivated in several parts of the world, becoming invasive in some of them. Aiming to understand the importance of jackfruit as a food resource for vertebrates, we review the literature describing jackfruit consumption both in areas where it is native and in areas where it is exotic. Jackfruit occurred in 72 countries; information on A. heterophyllus frugivory was found in 56 published works and it was consumed by 63 vertebrate species from 31 families—mostly mammals—including 19 species classified under some degree of threat by the IUCN. Pulp was the most consumed part of the fruits by eight species in native areas and by 32 in areas where the jackfruit is exotic. In non-native areas, three studies reported or suggested increased population densities of some frugivores that consume jackfruit in disturbed areas, while another study described the disruption of native ecological interactions due to a higher attractiveness of the exotic fruit. Due to its high nutritional content, jackfruit removal in areas where it is invasive should be gradual or associated with the replacement by native species with fleshy fruits to avoid frugivore population collapses.},

A total of 50 species of herpeto-mammalian fauna was recorded from the  study area. Of these, 5(10%) were amphibians, 20 (40%) reptiles and 25 (50%) mammals. In the amphibians, 3 species were common, rest one species was fairly  common and one few. In the reptiles, 5 species were very common, 4 common, 7 fairly common, 3 few and only one species was occasionally found. Of the mammals, 2 species were very common, 5 common, 10 fairly common, 6 few and 2 species were occasional. Among the total species, 3 species of amphibians were vulnerable nationally, 4 species of reptiles were critically endangered, 4 endangered and 4 vulnerable and one species of mammals were critically endangered (Lutra lutra), 6 endangered and 4 species were vulnerable nationally. Group discussion with the local people indicated that species diversity of herpetomammalian fauna has been decreased day by day in the study area. This might be due to the results of highly disturbance by human. Meanwhile, increase of human  population, destruction of habitat, expansion of agricultural activities, illegal hunting and trade are the main causes for declining herpeto-mammalian fauna in  the study area. The study suggests that creation of public awareness, improvement of ecological condition and implementing a management action plan are necessary to conserve the herpeto-mammalian fauna in the study area DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/bjz.v40i1.12903 Bangladesh J.

   abstract = {<p> Different spatial and temporal factors can influence the species richness and abundance of leaf anurans that are fundamental for the ecosystem functioning, as they act as predators and integrate the trophic chain as prey of other animals. There are relatively few studies that aimed to understand the spatio-temporal variation and the influence of environmental factors on leaf litter communities. We studied parameters of the anuran community living in the forest leaf litter in the Duas Bocas Biological Reserve (DBBR), Espírito Santo, Brazil. We sought to understand the extent to which richness, abundance, biomass and density varied between two locations with different stages of preservation (primary and secondary forest). In addition, we tested the effect of temperature and local humidity on abundance. We conducted the samplings monthly from October 2017 to September 2018, establishing 98 4 x 4 m plots (16 m <sup>2</sup> each) demarcated on the DBBR forest leaf litter. We measured temperature (°C) and relative air humidity (%), and each plot was carefully surveyed by four observers. We tested for differences in anuran density between the two sampled locations and estimated the effects of environmental variables in the community. We recorded 102 individuals of anurans from 11 species belonging to eight families. The DBBR anuran community parameters significantly differed between the two studied locations, with the highest values of anuran richness and abundance occurring in the area covered by primary forest, probably due to differences in the preservation of each area. However, temperature and humidity did not affect the abundance of anurans in the sampled areas. Our results provide the first information about spatial variation and influence of environmental factors, directed to the community of leaf litter anurans in DBBR, and represents the second study on this group of anurans in the state of Espírito Santo. </p>},

   abstract = {Abstract
Aim
Models of species niches and distributions have become invaluable to biogeographers over the past decade, yet several outstanding methodological issues remain. Here we address three critical ones: selecting appropriate evaluation data, detecting overfitting, and tuning program settings to approximate optimal model complexity. We integrate solutions to these issues for Maxent models, using the Caribbean spiny pocket mouse, Heteromys anomalus, as an example.

Location
North-western South America.

Methods
We partitioned data into calibration and evaluation datasets via three variations of k-fold cross-validation: randomly partitioned, geographically structured and masked geographically structured (which restricts background data to regions corresponding to calibration localities). Then, we carried out tuning experiments by varying the level of regularization, which controls model complexity. Finally, we gauged performance by quantifying discriminatory ability and overfitting, as well as via visual inspections of maps of the predictions in geography.

Results
Performance varied among data-partitioning approaches and among regularization multipliers. The randomly partitioned approach inflated estimates of model performance and the geographically structured approach showed high overfitting. In contrast, the masked geographically structured approach allowed selection of high-performing models based on all criteria. Discriminatory ability showed a slight peak in performance around the default regularization multiplier. However, regularization levels two to four times higher than the default yielded substantially lower overfitting. Visual inspection of maps of model predictions coincided with the quantitative evaluations.

Main conclusions
Species-specific tuning of model parameters can improve the performance of Maxent models. Further, accurate estimates of model performance and overfitting depend on using independent evaluation data. These strategies for model evaluation may be useful for other modelling methods as well.},

   abstract = {Algorithms for producing ecological niche models and species distribution models are widely applied in biogeography and conservation biology. However, in some cases models produced by these algorithms may not represent optimal levels of complexity and, hence, likely either overestimate or underestimate the species’ ecological tolerances. Here, we evaluate a delete-one jackknife approach for tuning model settings to approximate optimal model complexity and enhance predictions for datasets with few (here, <10) occurrence records. We apply this approach to tune two settings that regulate model complexity (feature class and regularization multiplier) in the presence-background modeling program Maxent for two species of spiny pocket mice in Ecuador and southwestern Colombia. For these datasets, we identified an optimal feature class parameter that is more complex than the default. Highly complex features are not typically recommended for use with small sample sizes in Maxent. However, when coupled with higher regularization, complex features (that allow more flexible responses to environmental variables) can obtain models that out-perform those built using default settings (employing less complex feature classes). Although small sample sizes remain a serious limitation to model building, this jackknife optimization approach can be used for species with few localities (<approximately 20–25) to produce models that maximize the utility of the little information available.},

I hypothesize that, in at least some species, males compete for calling sites in areas with high female density and with favorable sound transmission features.

   abstract = {<p>Climate change can affect species distribution patterns in three different ways: pushing them to disperse to new suitable areas, forcing them to adapt to novel climatic conditions, or driving them to extinction. However, the biological and geographical traits that lead to these different responses remain poorly explored. Here, we evaluated how ecological and biogeographic traits influence amphibians’ response to climate change. We performed a systematic review searching for studies that evaluated the effects of future climate change on amphibian’s distribution. Our research returned 31 articles that projected the distribution of 331 amphibians. Our results demonstrate that species inhabiting an elevation above 515 m will lose a significant portion of their climatically suitable area. We also found that as isothermality increases, the amount of area suitable in response to climate change also increases. Another important discovery was that as the size of the baseline area increases, the greater must be the loss of climatically suitable areas. On the other hand, species with very small areas tend to keep their current climatically suitable area in the future. Furthermore, our results indicate that species that inhabit dry habitats tend to expand their suitable area in response to climate change. This result can be explained by the environmental characteristics of these habitats, which tend to present extreme seasonal climates with well-defined periods of drought and rain. We also found that anurans that inhabit exclusively forests are projected to lose a greater portion of their suitable areas, when compared to species that inhabit both forest and open areas, wetlands, and dry and rupestrian environments. The biogeographical realm also influenced anuran’s range shifts, with Afrotropic and Nearctic species projected to expand their geographical ranges. The assessment of climate change effects on amphibian distribution has been the focus of a growing number of studies. Despite this, some regions and species remain underrepresented. Current literature evaluates about 4% of the 7,477 species of Anura and 8% of the 773 species of Caudata and some regions rich in amphibian species remain severely underrepresented, such as Madagascar. Thus, future studies should focus on regions and taxas that remain underrepresented.</p>},

A total of 60 anuran species belonging to eight families was recorded. Species richness and levels of endemism were higher in the Atlantic rainforest site. Sites located in the Cerrado domain were more alike than those located in the Atlantic Forest Domain. Similarity in anuran species composition was negatively correlated to the geographical distance among sites, which explains part of similarities in species composition. Factors affecting these occurrence patterns are discussed. One species (if its identity is confirmed) is considered Data Deficient by IUCN (The World Conservation Union), though it is not included in the Brazilian list of threatened amphibians.

   abstract = {The robustness of quantitative measures of compositional dissimilarity between sites was evaluated using extensive computer simulations of species' abundance patterns over one and two dimensional configurations of sample sites in ecological space. Robustness was equated with the strength over a range of models, of the linear and monotonic (rank-order) relationship between the compositional dissimilarities and the corresponding Euclidean distances between sites measured in the ecological space. The range of models reflected different assumptions about species' response curve shape, sampling pattern of sites, noise level of the data, species' interactions, trends in total site abundance, and beta diversity of gradients.

The Kulczynski, Bray-Curtis and Relativized Manhattan measures were found to have not only a robust monotonic relationship with ecological distance, but also a robust linear (proportional) relationship until ecological distances became large. Less robust measures included Chord distance, Kendall's coefficient, Chisquared distance, Manhattan distance, and Euclidean distance.

A new ordination method, hybrid multidimensional scaling (HMDS), is introduced that combines metric and nonmetric criteria, and so takes advantage of the particular properties of robust dissimilarity measures such as the Kulczynski measure.

We evaluated the relationship of the dissimilarity of assemblages with the distance types, using Mantel tests. In addition, we evaluated the relationships among the diversity components at multiple spatial scales, using additive partitioning analysis. The biological dissimilarities were correlated only with the geographical distances. Additive partitioning showed that the values of richness observed in the β1 (among Surber), β2 (among riffles), β3 (among streams), and β4 (among microbasins) were higher than those expected. The highest variation of the richness was found in β3 (30.6%).

analysis, in spatial analysis of ecological data. MRM involves a multiple regression of a response matrix on
any number of explanatory matrices, where each matrix contains distances or similarities (in terms of
ecological, spatial, or other attributes) between all pair-wise combinations of n objects (sample units); tests
of statistical significance are performed by permutation. The method is flexible in terms of the types of data
that may be analyzed (counts, presence –absence, continuous, categorical) and the shapes of response
curves. MRM offers several advantages over traditional partial Mantel analysis: (1) separating environmental distances into distinct distance matrices allows inferences to be made at the level of individual
variables; (2) nonparametric or nonlinear multiple regression methods may be employed; and (3) spatial
autocorrelation may be quantified and tested at different spatial scales using a series of lag matrices, each
representing a geographic distance class. The MRM lag matrices model may be parameterized to yield very
similar inferences regarding spatial autocorrelation as the Mantel correlogram. Unlike the correlogram,
however, the lag matrices model may also include environmental distance matrices, so that spatial patterns
in species abundance distances (community similarity) may be quantified while controlling for the environmental similarity between sites. Examples of spatial analyses with MRM are presented.},

Even for a community where all species have equal abundance, each added species usually leads to a smaller increment in the diversity measure than the species added before it. A recent proposal to solve this problem was to transform classical diversity measures to ‘effective numbers of species’ or ‘Hill numbers.’ For any community with diversity D, the effective number of species N is the number of equally abundant species that is needed to get a diversity value equal to D. The conversion of classical diversity measures to Hill numbers makes them linear with respect to species addition such that, given two equally large and completely distinct communities, each with diversity D, if these communities are pooled, the diversity of the pooled communities is 
. According to this proposal, Hill numbers have been widely adopted in ecological literature as the ultimate solution for diversity analysis regardless of the scientific question at hand. In contrast, we believe that assuming a non-linear response of diversity measures to species addition is more suitable for many ecological questions. Building on this idea, we have introduced a typification of diversity measures based on how quickly diversity increases as species are added.},

Although we have not encountered any strong justification of the methodology, we have encountered, through carrying out the methodology in well-known data sets with severe multicollinearity, serious actual and potential pitfalls in the methodology. We address these pitfalls as cautionary notes, numerical examples that use well-known data sets. We also illustrate by theory and example that it is possible for the PCR to fail miserably in the sense that when the response variable is regressed on all of the p principal components (PCs), the first (p − 1) PCs contribute nothing toward the reduction of the residual sum of squares, yet the last PC alone (the one that is always discarded according to PCR methodology) contributes everything. We then give conditions under which the PCR totally fails in the above sense.},

   abstract = {<p>Count data arise frequently in ecological analyses, but regularly violate the equi‐dispersion constraint imposed by the most popular distribution for analyzing these data, the Poisson distribution. Several approaches for addressing over‐dispersion have been developed (e.g., negative binomial distribution), but methods for including both under‐dispersion and over‐dispersion have been largely overlooked. We provide three specific examples drawn from life‐history theory, spatial ecology, and community ecology, and illustrate the use of the Conway‐Maxwell‐Poisson (CMP) distribution as compared to other common models for count data. We find that where equi‐dispersion is violated, the CMP distribution performs significantly better than the Poisson distribution, as assessed by information criteria that account for the CMP's additional distribution parameter. The Conway‐Maxwell‐Poisson distribution has seen rapid development in other fields such as risk analysis and linguistics, but is relatively unknown in the ecological literature. In addition to providing a more flexible exponential distribution for count data that is easily integrated into generalized linear models, the CMP allows ecologists to focus on the magnitude of under‐ or over‐dispersion as opposed to the simple rejection of the equi‐dispersion null hypothesis. By demonstrating its suitability in a variety of common ecological applications, we hope to encourage its wider adoption as a flexible alternative to the Poisson.</p>},

   abstract = {Distributions of species, animals or plants, terrestrial or aquatic, are influenced by numerous factors such as physical and biogeographical gradients. Dominant wind and current directions cause the appearance of gradients in physical conditions whereas biogeographical gradients can be the result of historical events (e.g. glaciations). No spatial modelling technique has been developed to this day that considers the direction of an asymmetric process controlling species distributions along a gradient or network. This paper presents a new method that can model species spatial distributions generated by a hypothesized asymmetric, directional physical process. This method is an eigenfunction-based spatial filtering technique that offers as much flexibility as the Moran's eigenvector maps (MEM) framework; it is called asymmetric eigenvector maps (AEM) modelling. Information needed to construct eigenfunctions through the AEM framework are the spatial coordinates of the sampling or experimental sites, a connexion diagram linking the sites to one another, prior information about the direction of the hypothesized asymmetric process influencing the response variable(s), and optionally, weights attached to the edges (links). To illustrate how this new method works, AEM is compared to MEM analysis through simulations and in the analysis of an ecological example where a known asymmetric forcing is present. The ecological example reanalyses the dietary habits of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) sampled in 42 lakes of the Mastigouche Reserve, Québec.},

Much attention has been given to zero-inflated count data, whereas models for non-negative continuous data with an abundance of 0s are much fewer. We consider zero-inflated data on the unit interval and provide modeling to capture two types of 0s in the context of a Beta regression model. We model 0s due to missing by chance through left-censoring of a latent regression and 0s due to unsuitability using an independent Bernoulli specification. We extend the model by introducing spatial random effects. We specify models hierarchically, employing latent variables, and fit them within a Bayesian framework. Our motivating dataset consists of percent cover abundance of two plant families at a collection of sites in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. We find that environmental features enable learning about both types of 0s as well as positive percent cover. We also show that the spatial random effects model improves predictive performance. The proposed modeling enables ecologists to extract a better understanding of an organism’s absence due to unsuitability vs. missingness by chance, as well as abundance behavior when present.},

The proposed model is useful for situations where the variable of interest is continuous and restricted to the interval (0, 1) and is related to other variables through a regression structure. The regression parameters of the beta regression model are interpretable in terms of the mean of the response and, when the logit link is used, of an odds ratio, unlike the parameters of a linear regression that employs a transformed response. Estimation is performed by maximum likelihood. We provide closed-form expressions for the score function, for Fisher's information matrix and its inverse. Hypothesis testing is performed using approximations obtained from the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. Some diagnostic measures are introduced.

   abstract = {t is well documented that the negative effects of habitat fragmentation are strong enough to promote local as well as regional extinction of canopy and emergent trees in neotropical forests. However, forest fragmentation does not occur alone, but is always associated with other human-induced threats to trees, such as logging, forest burning and hunting of key vertebrate seed dispersers within forest remnants. This association occurs because forest resources are, at least during a certain period, the main income source for local human populations. It is now possible to establish how these threats act in concert causing tree species impoverishment. Based on a predictive model, it is predicted that the most fragmented forest regions have lost or will lose an important part of their tree diversity. New integrated research must urgently test this prediction and investigate how human activities might be regulated in both old and new tropical forest frontiers to avoid species loss. If we fail to do this we will miss the opportunity of proposing sound and efficient guidelines to rescue neotropical forests from species impoverishment.},

Estas abordagens apresentam conceitos e definições distintas e por vezes conflitantes, que dificultam a concepção de um arcabouço teórico comum. Nesse trabalho, proponho uma definição integradora de paisagem como sendo "um mosaico heterogêneo formado por unidades interativas, sendo esta heterogeneidade existente para pelo menos um fator, segundo um observador e numa determinada escala de observação". Esse "mosaico heterogêneo" é essencialmente visto pelos olhos do homem, na abordagem geográfica, e pelo olhar das espécies ou comunidades estudadas na abordagem ecológica. O conceito de paisagem proposto evidencia ainda que a paisagem não é obrigatoriamente um amplo espaço geográfico ou um novo nível hierárquico de estudo em ecologia, justo acima de ecossistemas, pois a escala e o nível biológico de análise dependem do observador e do objeto de estudo. A ecologia de paisagens vem promovendo uma mudança de paradigma nos estudos sobre fragmentação e conservação de espécies e ecossistemas, pois permite a integração da heterogeneidade espacial e do conceito de escala na análise ecológica, tornando esses trabalhos ainda mais aplicados para resolução de problemas ambientais.</p>},

   abstract = {The objectives of this study were to analyze the relationship between the AVHRR data [transformed into a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)] and ecological variables and, secondly, to evaluate the possibility of estimating actual evapotranspiration using AVHRR and other readily available data. The study was undertaken across a range of conditions in Canada. Meteorological and composited NDVI data were compiled for 15-day periods over the 1986 growing season and were supplemented by digital ecological and soil data. The effect of soil and meteorological conditions on vegetation growth was modeled using the Versatile Soil Moisture Budget model, which accounts for additions and losses of water from various layers in the root zone. The various data sets were integrated using a geographic information system. We found that individual vegetation/soil combinations exhibited different NDVI trajectories, most closely related to the trends in potential evapotranspiration. There was a highly significant association between coincident NDVI and actual evapotranspiration values (r = 0.77) or between NDVI and potential evapotranspiration for the previous 15-day period (r = 0.86). High correlation was found between cumulative NDVI and cumulative actual evapotranspiration over the growing season (r = 0.96). Actual evapotranspiration for individual 15-day periods could be estimated from NDVI and potential evapotranspiration values with a residual error of about 10–15%. The results show that the NDVI trajectories provide important information on the seasonal development of vegetation at northern latitudes. Results in estimating actual evapotranspiration were also encouraging but further work is needed to determine the accuracy limits for this geographic area. The representativeness of the 1986 results for the region is subject of continuing study with 6 years of NDVI data.},

A similar general formula is also proposed for the Marczewski-Steinhaus coefficient. Finally, using a modified version of Dalton’s principle of transfers, we show that the Bray-Curtis coefficient and the city-block distance exhibit a linear response to the transfer of species abundances from an abundant plot to a less abundant plot. At the other extreme, the chord and the Hellinger distances show an irregular and non-monotonic behavior.},

   abstract = {<p>Species spatial distributions are the result of population demography, behavioral traits, and species interactions in spatially heterogeneous environmental conditions. Hence the composition of species assemblages is an integrative response variable, and its variability can be explained by the complex interplay among several structuring factors. The thorough analysis of spatial variation in species assemblages may help infer processes shaping ecological communities. We suggest that ecological studies would benefit from the combined use of the classical statistical models of community composition data, such as constrained or unconstrained multivariate analyses of site‐by‐species abundance tables, with rapidly emerging and diversifying methods of spatial pattern analysis. Doing so allows one to deal with spatially explicit ecological models of beta diversity in a biogeographic context through the multiscale analysis of spatial patterns in original species data tables, including spatial characterization of fitted or residual variation from environmental models. We summarize here the recent progress for specifying spatial features through spatial weighting matrices and spatial eigenfunctions in order to define spatially constrained or scale‐explicit multivariate analyses. Through a worked example on tropical tree communities, we also show the potential of the overall approach to identify significant residual spatial patterns that could arise from the omission of important unmeasured explanatory variables or processes.</p>},

However, there is still a gap of annual land use and land cover (LULC) information in all Brazilian biomes in the country. Existing countrywide efforts to map land use and land cover lack regularly updates and high spatial resolution time-series data to better understand historical land use and land cover dynamics, and the subsequent impacts in the country biomes. In this study, we described a novel approach and the results achieved by a multi-disciplinary network called MapBiomas to reconstruct annual land use and land cover information between 1985 and 2017 for Brazil, based on random forest applied to Landsat archive using Google Earth Engine. We mapped five major classes: forest, non-forest natural formation, farming, non-vegetated areas, and water. These classes were broken into two sub-classification levels leading to the most comprehensive and detailed mapping for the country at a 30 m pixel resolution. The average overall accuracy of the land use and land cover time-series, based on a stratified random sample of 75,000 pixel locations, was 89% ranging from 73 to 95% in the biomes. The 33 years of LULC change data series revealed that Brazil lost 71 Mha of natural vegetation, mostly to cattle ranching and agriculture activities. Pasture expanded by 46% from 1985 to 2017, and agriculture by 172%, mostly replacing old pasture fields. We also identified that 86 Mha of the converted native vegetation was undergoing some level of regrowth. Several applications of the MapBiomas dataset are underway, suggesting that reconstructing historical land use and land cover change maps is useful for advancing the science and to guide social, economic and environmental policy decision-making processes in Brazil.</p>},

In total, 97 species belonging to two orders, 15 families and 36 genera were recorded. Of these, 50 are endemic to the Atlantic Forest and 14 have restricted distribution to the PEC. The total surface richness indicated areas of greater species richness predominantly in the central portion of the PEC, constituting regions that still present Dense Ombrophilous Forest fragments. Furthermore, a very representative number regarding the conservation of species is threatened or lacking available population data. Despite the growing number of studies published in the last 2 decades, knowledge about the amphibian fauna of the PEC is still incipient.

Vertebrates are the main food item consumed by the species (78% of species), among the main prey are mammals, lizards, and amphibians. Most species show a strictly nocturnal activity period (50%), followed by strictly diurnal (38%). The PEC is the most degraded and least known region of the Atlantic Forest, yet it has revealed a high richness of snake species, including seven endemic species. It is emphasized that regional conservation efforts need to be intensified, because few forests in the region are formally protected, and the majority consist of small and poorly protected fragments, which means that many species in the region may be in risk of extinction.</p>},

This is particularly true for herpetofaunas (including amphibians and reptiles). Here, using correlation and regression analyses, we examine the relationship of herpetofaunal species richness in 245 localities across China with 30 environmental factors, which include nearly all major environmental factors that are considered to explain broad‐scale species richness gradients in such theories as ambient energy, water–energy dynamics, productivity, habitat heterogeneity, and climatic stability. We found that the species richness of amphibians and reptiles is moderately to strongly correlated with most of the environmental variables examined, and that the best fit models, which include explanatory variables of temperature, precipitation, net primary productivity, minimum elevation, and range in elevation, explain ca 70% the variance in species richness for both amphibians and reptiles after accounting for sample area. Although water and temperature are important explanatory variables to both amphibians and reptiles, water variables explain more variance in amphibian species richness than in reptile species richness whereas temperature variables explain more variance in reptile species richness than in amphibian species richness, which is consistent with different physiological requirements of the two groups of organisms.</p>},

Experimental work demonstrates that tadpoles of stream-breeding anurans can exhibit a top-down influence on aquatic primary productivity (APP), but few studies have sought evidence of a bottom-up influence of primary productivity on anuran abundance, species richness and community composition, as seen in other organisms. We examined aquatic and terrestrial primary productivity in two forest types in Borneo, along with amphibian abundance, species richness, and community composition at larval and adult stages, to determine whether there is evidence for a bottom-up influence of APP on tadpole abundance and species richness across streams, and the relative importance of aquatic and terrestrial primary productivity on larval and adult phases of anurans. We predicted that adult richness, abundance, and community composition would be influenced by terrestrial primary productivity, but that tadpole richness, abundance, and community composition would be influenced by APP. Contrary to expectations, we did not find evidence that primary productivity, or variation thereof, predicts anuran richness at larval or adult stages. Further, no measure of primary productivity or its variation was a significant predictor of adult abundance, or of adult or tadpole community composition. For tadpoles, we found that in areas with low terrestrial primary productivity, abundance was positively related to APP, but in areas with high terrestrial primary productivity, abundance was negatively related to APP, suggesting a bottom-up influence of primary productivity on abundance in secondary forest, and a top-down influence of tadpoles on primary productivity in primary forest. Additional data are needed to better understand the ecological interactions between terrestrial primary productivity, aquatic primary productivity, and tadpole abundance.</p>},

Satellite remote sensing (SRS) provides information relevant to the study of biodiversity and associated environmental traits at multiple spatial and temporal resolutions. Pond-breeding amphibians allow for comparative ecological analysis regarding the influence of environmental heterogeneity derived from SRS. Here, we characterize the influence of heterogeneity in abiotic (TWI, LST) and habitat-related (NDVI, NDWI) factors derived at fine spatial resolution on reproductive activity in the anuran community of the South Altiplano semiarid biogeographic province in Mexico. We used anuran reproductive data from seasonal and permanent water bodies and tested for the influence of abiotic and habitat heterogeneity with a spatiotemporal perspective using multivariate analysis, linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) and ecological niche models (ENMs). The results suggest that habitat heterogeneity best explains reproductive activity, whereas abiotic heterogeneity was second in importance. Implementation of ENMs using these abiotic and habitat heterogeneity variables allowed the detection of areas highly suitable for breeding across the study region. This research underlines the importance of environmental heterogeneity for predicting anuran breeding areas and their species compositions in the semiarid South Altiplano region of Mexico.},

   abstract = {A central issue for ecologists is to understand the variables that determine species distribution. Many studies have suggested that environmental variables are the main factors that shape anuran communities. Nevertheless, several natural environments have not been assessed with ecological studies of this nature, including specific ecosystems of the South American Cerrado morphoclimatic domain. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between environmental variables and the spatial distribution of anurans in ecosystems of semi-deciduous and riparian forests in a transitional region between the Cerrado and Caatinga environments in the western Bahia state, Brazil. We collected fauna and environmental variables data in 10 sampling units during two rainy periods. The original information on species composition and abundance in the community was reduced to a single axis using a non-metric multidimensional scaling method (NMDS) and environmental data were reduced to two main factors using a principal component analysis (PCA). We tested the absence of an association between the structural variation of the environment and spatial distribution of the anuran community using a multiple regression analysis. The anuran community was ordered following a gradient of dry semi-deciduous seasonal areas toward riparian forest with areas of direct insolation and lentic water bodies. Among the components extracted by the PCA, only PC1 was associated with anuran community composition, explaining 69% of the ordination obtained by the NMDS according to variables related to the presence of water bodies. The great contribution of water bodies appears to reflect the degree of modification of the landscape in the region and seasonal restrictions in the availability of water, with both aspects increasing the expected influence of water bodies on the distribution of anurans in the western Bahia state. Future investigations exploring the structure of anurofauna during dry seasons could extend and complement the results provided by this study.},

   abstract = {<p>The margins of large rivers are usually impacted by human settlements and activities, which may affect the occupancy and use of riparian habitats by many organisms. Among vertebrates, amphibians are likely the most sensitive to environmental changes, and they can be used as a model to identify attributes of the riparian habitats that are important for the maintenance of high species richness and functional diversity. We studied anuran assemblages in four large rivers of the Velhas River basin in southeastern Brazil during one year, focusing on features of the rivers and riparian habitats that influence species distribution. We tested whether a river under greater anthropogenic impact would shelter less species compared to three rivers of equivalent size under lower impact level, and whether lower species richness related to lower availability of preferred microhabitats. We found soil type at river margin and riparian vegetation structure to be the main factors influencing anuran distribution. Species richness was positively related to microhabitat diversity and availability of preferred microhabitats, which were the lowest in the most impacted river. Most species recorded at the rivers were not breeding there, and were present in larger numbers during the dry season, when temporary bodies of water dry at the vicinities of the large rivers. Conservation of a broad extension of the riparian habitat (200 m or more) would be efficient both to provide appropriate microhabitats for anurans and to maintain connectivity between breeding sites and large, permanent rivers used by several species during the dry season.

In this study we present information on the diet composition, reproduction, and sexual dimorphism of B. raniceps in the Caatinga biome, northeastern Brazil, providing additional information about the natural history of the species. We observed that B. raniceps has a generalist diet, consuming a great diversity of prey categories, but with a numerical and volumetric prevalence of Coleoptera. Interestingly, there was an ontogenetic and sexual variation in the diet, with the Relative Importance Index (RII) for each prey category differed between males, females, and juveniles. Females were found bearing mature eggs in both the rainy and dry seasons. The number of eggs carried by each female ranged from 153 to 3904. There was sexual dimorphism in body size, with females larger than males. However, size was not a limiting factor in fecundity. Here, we present new information on the natural history of B. raniceps and reinforce the need for further studies with widely distributed and known species. This is the first study to demonstrate ontogenetic and sexual variation in the diet of anurans of the genus Boana.</p>},

However, few studies focus on forest edges, created during the fragmentation process, as proximate drivers of the local demographic structure of populations. Here, we use abundance data of amphibians and reptiles to study their responses to forest edges in nine fragmented forested landscapes of the Neotropics. Species-specific abundance data were collected in plots established at varying distances from their respective nearest forest edge. We tested for edge effects on the abundance of species, and used curve clustering techniques to group species with similar edge responses, i.e. species with either increasing or decreasing abundance from the matrix towards the forest interior. We also grouped species that showed no change in abundance with respect to the nearest forest edge and those whose abundance response was unimodal, peaking in either forest habitat or the surrounding matrix habitat. We found that 96% of all amphibians and 90% of all reptiles showed an edge response, with the abundance of 74.5% of amphibians and 57.3% of reptiles decreasing with increasing proximity to forest edges. However, species-specific edge effects were not always consistent, with some species having opposite edge responses when measured in different landscapes. The depth of edge effects exhibited by forest species, i.e. species that increased in abundance in the forest interior, extended up to one kilometre away from forest edges. We show that the median edge effect on forest species extends to 250m within the forest interior, indicating that tropical forest patches with a mean diameter<500m (minimum area≈78ha) are unsuitable for half of forest-dependent species considered in this study.},

Using species distribution models, we generated geographic projections for six time periods, including the Last Interglacial, Last Glacial Maximum, Mid Holocene, current time, and two periods in the future under two climate change scenarios each. We defined climate refugia as areas where the geographic distributions of species overlapped in the three time periods in the past and present. We observed a maximum overlap of 40 species and found them mainly in parts of the southeastern and northeastern Atlantic Forest. These refugia should remain suitable for most species in future climate change scenarios, making them important for conservation. Our study highlights the importance of these areas to maintain biodiversity and prevent the loss of endemic anuran species in the megadiverse Atlantic Forest. Overall, our findings have important implications for conservation planning in the Atlantic Forest and other regions affected by climate change.},

Drivers such as logging and climate extremes are thought to collectively erode diversity, but their interactions are not well understood. However, ignoring such complexities may result in poor conservation management decisions. Here, we present the first study dealing with the complexity arising from the effects of interactions of two increasingly important disturbance factors (selective logging and climatic extreme events) on beta diversity patterns at different scales. Specifically, we examined extensive amphibian assemblage datasets obtained within a quasi‐experimental pre‐/post‐harvesting scheme in the lowland rainforests of Central Guyana. Changes in small‐scale patterns of beta diversity were not detectable at the higher landscape level, indicating that local‐scale dynamics are more informative for evaluating disturbance impacts. The results also underscore the importance of including abundance data when investigating homogenization or heterogenization effects, which should be considered when designing post‐logging impact assessments and selecting impact indicators. Moreover, logging should be regarded as a multifaceted driver that contributes to changes in biodiversity patterns in different ways, depending on interactions with other drivers. The effects of extreme climate events were significantly more pronounced in unlogged forest, while logged forest assemblages appeared buffered due to the presence of novel habitats. Imprudent post‐logging renaturation measures may thus counteract conservation targets. These findings highlight the fact that indicator bias and unaccounted interactions between multiple drivers can lead to misguided management strategies.</p>},

Data from a pitfall study carried out in the dry Chaco of Argentina were used to address the question of how species are distributed in their assemblage through time. Lizard activity and species richness were highest in the spring breeding season and declined in the cool months of the year. Variations in seasonal activity patterns and reproductive chronology resulted in significantly different distributions of species in every sample month. Not only did the species composition of the assemblage change through time, but the mean size of lizards and the proportions of males, females, and juveniles varied significantly for several species. Large lizards, regardless of species, disappeared from the assemblage during the cool, dry winter, while juveniles of the large species remained active year round. Adults of the smallest species were also active throughout the year. We propose an hypothesis based on thermoregulatory constraints of lizard body size to account for these patterns. An approach focusing on the energetics and physiological ecology of individual species would be fruitful in understanding the dynamics of fluctuating lizard communities.},

This study examined how seasonality influences the trophic ecology of three sympatric Tropidurus lizards. We sampled 100 individuals in the Brazilian Caatinga, a domain known for its marked seasonal changes. We analyzed lizard stomachs and food items were quantified in terms of frequency of occurrence, number, and volume. We compared diets, both between the three species and within the same species during distinct seasons, using indexes of relative importance, niche overlap and niche breadth. Ants and plant matter were among the most important items for all species, but the composition of supplementary items was variable among species and seasons. Trophic niche overlap between all species approximated 0.4 during the rainy season and changed markedly during the dry season. During the dry season, the species T. cocorobensis and T. semitaeniatus presented narrower feeding niches and T. hispidus presented a more ample feeding niche. Spatial segregation in microhabitats might explain the trophic patterns observed herein; where specialized species—T. cocorobensis and T. semitaeniatus—experience little spatial overlap, allowing for more similar diets during periods of food scarcity, such as during the dry season. Our results indicate that seasonality can be a major driver of tropidurid lizard dietary preferences, which, along with the interaction of species' habitat use, is determinant for competition relationships between lizards and their roles in ecosystem trophic dynamics.

Lagartos podem prosperar em habitats inóspitos, às vezes adaptando suas dietas para resistir às condições ambientais. A sazonalidade é um dos vetores mais prevalentes que modificam a dinâmica trófica dos lagartos, influenciando nas adaptações morfológicas e ecológicas. Este estudo examinou como a sazonalidade influencia a ecologia trófica de três lagartos Tropidurus simpátricos. Amostramos cem indivíduos na Caatinga brasileira, um domínio conhecido por marcadas mudanças sazonais entre estações. Analisamos itens alimentares quantificados em frequência de ocorrência, número e volume. Comparamos as dietas entre as três espécies e dentro da mesma espécie em estações distintas, usando índices de importância relativa, sobreposição e amplitude de nicho. Formigas e matéria vegetal estiveram entre os itens mais importantes, mas a composição dos itens suplementares foi variável entre as espécies e estações. A sobreposição de nicho trófico entre todas as espécies foi de aproximadamente 0,4 na estação chuvosa, mudando acentuadamente na seca. As espécies T. cocorobensis e T. semitaeniatus tiveram nichos alimentares estreitos durante a seca, enquanto para T. hispidus foi expandido. A segregação espacial em microhabitats pode explicar os padrões tróficos aqui observados; espécies especializadas—T. cocorobensis e T. semitaeniatus—têm pouca sobreposição espacial, o que lhes permite ter dietas mais semelhantes por ocasião da escassez de alimentos, como na estação seca. Nossos resultados indicam que a sazonalidade pode ser um grande impulsionador das preferências alimentares dos lagartos tropidurídeos, que, juntamente com a interação com o uso do habitat, é determinante para as relações de competição entre lagartos e seus papéis na dinâmica trófica do ecossistema.},

We collected lizards using pitfall traps and active searching; we also collected data concerning microhabitat and diet composition for the lizard species examined. We used null models to test whether or not the community was structured following microhabitat or trophic niches. We also tested whether or not such structure had a historical or ecological origin using canonical phylogenetic ordination and phylogenetic principal component analysis. Gymnodactylus geckoides and Tropidurus hispidus were most generalized in their microhabitat use. Hemidactylus brasilianus and Phyllopezus pollicaris had the greatest numeric niche breadth, whereas P. pollicaris and T. hispidus had the greatest volumetric niche breadth. In contrast, Brasiliscincus heathi and Ameiva ameiva had the smallest numeric and volumetric niche breadths, respectively. The lizard assemblage examined had structure in both microhabitat and trophic niches. We detected phylogenetic conservatism on the basis of spatial niches in the clades Teoidea, Teiidae, and Tropiduridae. In contrast to the predictions of the niche complementarity hypothesis, we found high trophic overlap coupled with low microhabitat overlap for tropidurids. Moreover, spatial niche structure was mainly attributable to historical factors (phylogenetic), whereas ecological factors were more important determinants of trophic niche structure.},

Detailed knowledge about its effects on the Chaco fauna is scarce despite the critical importance of such information for biodiversity conservation. The effects of habitat degradation on the Arid Chaco lizard assemblage were evaluated by comparing species richness and abundance in four sites along a gradient of increasing vegetation degradation. Two undisturbed sites (primary forest and grassland), and two sites with different degrees of forest degradation (moderate and severe) were selected. Ten lizard species were recorded (nine were trapped and one was sighted), totaling 1122 captures. Abundance of Homonota fasciata, Leiosaurus paronae, Liolaemus chacoensis and Stenocercus doellojuradoi was highest in the primary forest, with significantly lower values in the remaining three sites. Teius teyou and Tropidurus etheridgei were more abundant in the moderately and severely degraded forests than in the primary forest. Management implications of our results in terms of lizard biodiversity in the Chaco are analyzed.},

   abstract = {Research on plant–animal interactions has been focused on direct consumer interactions (i.e. plants as resources), but non-trophic interactions including providing shelter or interference with movement can also affect the fine-scale distribution of animals. In particular, non-trophic interactions that are positive could support threatened animal populations. Positive interactions have been used in the restoration of plant communities, but have not yet been extended to the management of animal habitat. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that non-trophic interactions influence the occurrence of an endangered lizard species in an arid shrub-annual system. At a location known to have a population of blunt-nosed leopard lizards (Gambelia sila), we geotagged 700 shrubs, measured shrub morphometric traits, collected biomass samples, and surveyed for lizard presence using scat detection dogs over two years. Relative to 2014, in 2013 plant productivity was high and lizard scats were found more frequently in areas with low invasive grass cover (i.e. residual dry matter, RDM). In 2014, plant productivity was low because of an extreme drought year, and lizard scats were more frequently observed under shrub canopies, particularly those with relatively dense cover. These findings support the novel theory that positive non-trophic interactions are a critical form of plant–animal interactions in addition to consumption. Dominant shrubs can act as a foundation species by functioning as a basal node in structuring both plant and animal communities through a network of interactions. Managing dominant plants, in addition to habitat, is therefore important for conserving animal species in arid ecosystems.},

In this study, the spatio-temporal species diversity and α and β functional diversity of lizard assemblages were evaluated in four vegetation types over a two-season annual cycle. Additionally, site structural elements including vegetation, soil and environmental variables were characterized and related to the composition of lizard species. Both species diversity and functional diversity varied through space and time but followed different trends. Species diversity was higher in lowland vegetation types, characterized by greater tree canopy coverage (%) as well as higher temperature and humidity conditions, while species richness, evenness and functional divergence showed distinct trends. Similarly, seasonal differences were observed in species and functional diversity: the rainy season had greater species diversity, while functional diversity was higher during the dry season. Also, species β-diversity between vegetation types was characterized by turnover; while nestedness was the main component of functional β-diversity. Seasonally, there was no turnover in species or functional diversity. We conclude that vegetation type is the primary determinant of lizard diversity. However, the functional redundancy observed in lizard communities explains the opposite tendencies found between species and functional diversity at α and β levels.},

   abstract = {<p>Mountain ecosystems act as natural experiments for investigating the relationship between environmental heterogeneity and species diversity. A review of the global altitudinal distribution of reptiles identified a diverse range of patterns driven by climate and taxonomy. No Australian examples were included in this analysis. We addressed this gap by surveying the reptile assemblage along an altitude gradient from upland rainforest (~1000 m) through to open savanna woodlands (~350 m) in north-eastern Australia. Reptiles were sampled on four separate occasions between May 2006 and November 2007. Thirty-six species, representing seven families, were recorded along the gradient. As we used only diurnal active searching, snakes and nocturnal geckoes were probably under-sampled; thus we considered only lizards in the analysis of altitude pattern. Lizard species richness peaked at the mid-altitudes (600–900 m, 11–12 spp.) and abundance highest at the lower (&lt;500 m) and higher (&gt;800 m) zones. This pattern is likely a factor of both the increase in radiant heat sources (reduced canopy cover) and increased species packing due to the diversity of niches available (presence of rock cover and increase in saxicolous species). In the lower-altitude sites the high abundance of few species seems linked to the dominance of disturbance-tolerant species. We conclude that lizard richness and abundance patterns on this transect are not necessarily exhibiting a mid-domain effect, but instead are a function of species-specific ecological and habitat requirements.</p>},

We recorded 35 species (pasture: 15, forest edge: 28, forest interior: 16). Reptile structure was different along the pasture-edge-interior gradient and the magnitude of the influence of the edge effect on the abundance of the most common species changed from the dry to rainy season. We identified seven ecological groups based on three fixed functional traits: species habit, size and reproductive mode. The proportion of species belonging to each ecological group was different between the pasture and forest habitats, but there were no differences between the forest edge and its interior. Four of the seven ecological groups inhabited pasture and the forest interior, and all of the ecological groups were represented in the forest edge. The ecological group with oviparous small and diurnal species accounted for the 50 % of the species inhabiting the forest interior. Reptile structure and ecological groups were both related to patch size, elevation, herbaceous cover, percentage of bare soil and temperature, but explanatory power differed. We suggest that the conservation and management of tropical dry forest reptiles should take into account species traits so that rather than using information for a single species, a more generalized community approach is used.},

We estimated beta-diversity and similarity among areas and related these parameters to geographic distance between areas. All areas were surveyed with a similar sampling procedure. We found 28 frog species belonging to the families Hylidae, Microhylidae, Leptodactylidae and Bufonidae. Frogs in restingas were in general nocturnal with no strictly diurnal species. The richest restinga was Praia das Neves (13 species), followed by Grussaí and Trancoso (eight species in each). The commonest species in the restingas was Scinax alter (found in eight restingas), followed by Aparasphenodon brunoi (seven areas). Our data shows that richness and composition of frog communities vary consistently along the eastern Brazilian coast and, in part, the rate of species turnover is affected by the distance among areas. Geographic distance explained approximately 12% of species turnover in restingas and about 9.5% of similarity among frog assemblages. Although geographic distance somewhat affects frog assemblages, other factors (e.g. historical factors, disturbances) seem to be also involved in explaining present frog assemblage composition in each area and species turnover among areas. The frog fauna along restinga habitats was significantly nested (matrix community temperature = 26.13°; p = 0.007). Our data also showed that the most hospitable restinga was Praia das Neves and indicated that this area should be protected as a conservation unit. Frog assemblage of each area seems to partially represent a nested subset of the original assemblage, although we should not ignore the importance of historical factors. This nestedness pattern, in part, probably results from the intensive fragmentation of restinga habitats. Possibly, many frog species may have been lost in some studied areas as a result of the extensive habitat degradation to which restinga habitats are presently exposed.</p>},

We examined species richness of larval amphibian communities in 37 ponds over seven years on the Univ. of Michigan's E. S. George Reserve. Ordination of the community incidence matrix indicated a strong major axis of variation in species associations that was correlated with pond hydroperiod, surface area and forest canopy cover. Communities were significantly nested with those species found in ponds with high canopy cover, small area and short hydroperiod being nested subsets of those found in ponds with contrasting characteristics. Presence of fish had strong negative effects on species richness; relaxation of this effect also was apparent when fish were extirpated from ponds by drought. We employed a model selection analysis to identify the most appropriate statistical model for predicting the long‐term average species richness of these ponds from local abiotic and biotic (predator and competitor density) factors. A model including only the abiotic factors was overwhelmingly superior for the anurans; hierarchical partitioning indicated that area and canopy cover alone accounted for over 70% of the independent effects of predictor variables. The global model including both abiotic and biotic factors was the best supported model for the caudates, and correspondingly hierarchical partitioning suggested that area, hydroperiod, invertebrate predators and caudate biomass all accounted for 9–16% of the independent effects. Overall, biotic factors accounted for much less of the variation in species richness than abiotic factors. The patterns in larger, open‐canopy ponds provided little evidence of competitive effects on species richness, though there were patterns consistent with competitive effects in small, closed‐canopy ponds. The unusual temporal and spatial extent of these data enabled us to critically evaluate ideas regarding patterns in larval amphibian communities, and the effects of area, disturbance (hydroperiod) and productivity (canopy cover) on species richness of these communities. These results have important implications to the conservation of amphibian species richness in freshwater wetlands, which are among the most threatened ecosystems worldwide.</p>},

SUMMARY Reciprocal averaging is a technique of indirect ordination, related both to weighted averages and to principal components analysis and other eigenvector techniques. A series of tests with simulated community gradients (coenoclines), simulated community patterns (coenoplanes), and sets of vegetation samples was used to compare ordination performance of reciprocal averaging (RA) with non-standardized and standardized principal components analysis (PCA) and polar or Bray-Curtis ordination (PO). Of these, non-standardized PCA is most vulnerable to effects of beta diversity, giving distorted ordinations of sample sets with three or more half-changes. PO and RA give good ordinations to five or more half-changes, and standardized PCA is intermediate. Sample errors affect all these techniques more at low than at high beta diversity, but PCA is most vulnerable to effects of sample errors. All three techniques could ordinate well a small (1-5 x 1-5 half-changes) simulated community pattern; and PO and RA could ordinate larger patterns (4 5 x 4-5 half-changes) well. PCA distorts larger community patterns into complex surfaces. Given a rectangular pattern (1-5 x 4-5 half-changes), RA distorts the major axis of sample variation into an arch in the second axis of ordination. Clusters of samples tend to distort PCA ordinations in rather unpredictable ways, but they have smaller effects on RA, and none on PO. Outlier samples do not affect PO (unless used as endpoints), but can cause marked deterioration in RA and PCA ordinations. RA and PO are little subject to the involution of axis extremes that affects non-standardized PCA. Despite the arch effect, RA is much superior to PCA at high beta diversities and on the whole preferable to PCA at low beta diversities. Second and higher axes of PCA and RA may express ecologically meaningless, curvilinear functions of lower axes. When curvilinear displacements are combined with sample error, axis interpretation is difficult. None of the techniques solves all the problems for ordination that result from the curvilinear relationships characteristic of community data. For applied ordination research consideration of sample set properties, careful use of supporting information to evaluate axes, and comparison of results of RA or PCA with PO and direct ordination are suggested.},

We recorded 3390 frogs from 55 species, which is three times more species than at any local community along the elevation gradient. Species diversity peaked at 1700 m a.s.l. for Mt.

The beta diversity between frog communities was high and increased with increasing elevation. The change in frog community composition across 500 m elevation corresponded to the change over 200 km distance within lowland forests. A majority of frog species were distributed over narrow &lt;500 m elevational ranges, at Mt Wilhelm and the New Guinea fauna more broadly. We did not detect Rapoport's pattern of wider elevation range for species at higher elevations than for lowland species, for Mt. Wilhelm communities or the New Guinea fauna.

The landscape structure of these systems is a major driver of biodiversity response. Generally, it is assumed that high levels of biodiversity occur in perennial systems largely due to their high structural complexity. However, little is known about the influence of other landscape attributes on these levels of biodiversity. Avocado ( <italic>Persea americana</italic> ) constitutes about 25 percent of the global fresh fruit trade. In Mexico, avocado trees flourish about the same altitude as pine–oak forests (POFs). We studied the response of the local herpetofauna to conversion of POF to avocado orchards (AOs). We also explored the effects of forest cover on species that differ in their levels of habitat specialization. In the avocado belt in Michoacan, we sampled 12 sites representing a gradient of AO embedded in native POF to evaluate the variation in structure of local assemblages of amphibians and reptiles. Reduction of POF cover negatively affected specialist frog and snake species, but this relationship varied among buffers around sampling sites. Generalist species of amphibians and lizards showed increased abundances and richness in sites with low POF cover, whereas snake richness and abundance were higher in sites with high POF cover. Our study suggests that POF conversion to AO is a driver favoring the persistence and success of generalist but not specialist herpetofauna species. Therefore, to conserve the diversity of amphibians and reptiles in these agroecosystems, it is important to ensure high proportion of POF patches. </p>},

In this study, we used camera‐trap data and a community Royle‐Nichols model to explore community structure of ground‐dwelling mammal and birds along a complex habitat gradient in Nui Chua NP. We first investigated species associations among three habitat types: dry forest, semi‐dry forest, and broadleaf wet evergreen forest. We then used occupancy‐based diversity profiles to assess diversity in these three habitats. Overall species diversity tended to be highest in the transitional semi‐dry forest ecotone, which supported species from both dry and evergreen forests. Notably, the semi‐dry forest also had the highest occupancies for several endemic and threatened species. Our findings highlight the importance of the semi‐dry forest for conservation in the broader coastal dry forest landscape. We emphasize the need for fine‐scale biodiversity assessments to inform conservation strategies, especially in habitats that may be overlooked by broader‐scale conservation strategies.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> Change in land‐use patterns affects a landscape by changing the composition of local flora and fauna. The lateritic plateaus in Konkan are one such example of this rapid land‐use change. Although these plateaus are rich in endemic flora and fauna, they are considered as “wastelands” due to lack of woody vegetation and thus, are subjected to various land‐uses. Mango cultivation in this region has become a major source of income due to its Alphonso variety of mangoes. Hence, over the last few decades, many plateaus have been converted into mango orchards. However, how the conversion of plateaus to mango orchards has affected species composition of different groups of organisms remains unclear. In the present study, we sampled the lateritic plateaus and plateaus converted into mango orchards in Ratnagiri, Maharashtra, to investigate the response of the reptile communities. We observed more species heterogeneity in the orchards compared to the unaltered sites. Moreover, it appeared that there was a species turnover when the plateaus were converted into orchards. The generalist and widespread species such as agamids and skinks and very few specialist species were comparatively more abundant in the orchards. On the contrary, the plateaus without orchards harbored more specialist species such as <italic>Hemidactylus albofasciatus</italic> ( <italic>n</italic>  = 62, in unaltered sites vs. <italic>n</italic>  = 5 in the orchards), <italic>Echis carinatus</italic> ( <italic>n</italic>  = 15 in unaltered sites and none in the orchards) and <italic>Ophisops jerdonii</italic> ( <italic>n</italic>  = 45 in unaltered site vs. <italic>n</italic>  = 12 in the orchards) compared to the generalist species. </p>},

   abstract = {<p>Tropical forests are vertically complex and offer unique niche opportunities in the form of resources, climate, and habitat gradients from the forest floor to the canopy. Rainforest amphibians have diversified within this vertical space, resulting in partitioned niches and corresponding morphological, behavioral, and reproductive traits. However, a lack of data regarding the vertical niche space used by amphibian species has prevented a nuanced analysis of the form‐function relationship between traits and vertical height. We performed 74 ground‐to‐canopy surveys for amphibians in the tropical rainforest of Gabon and described the vertical stratification patterns of the assemblage in terms of richness, abundance, and species‐specific vertical niches. We determined that the community shift in richness and abundance between the ground and understory was pronounced, while the community change from understory to canopy was gradual. We analyzed the relationships between amphibian traits with vertical height using linear mixed effects models, finding strong support (&gt;60% variance explained) that frogs with bigger toes in relation to their length access greater height in the canopy. This relationship provides support for the form‐function hypothesis: that morphology changes predictably to meet the functional demands of species along niche gradients. Furthermore, we documented differences in the vertical heights of species according to their reproductive modes, highlighting the potential impact of reproductive mode diversity on the vertical stratification patterns of amphibian assemblages.</p>},

The Western Ghats of India are home to a mosaic of closely spaced habitats, including forests and agroecosystems. Cashew is a widely grown plantation crop in the northern Western Ghats and is known to provide economic and societal benefits. However, its role as a supplementary habitat for anurans is not well understood. We assessed the factors that influence understorey anuran composition and abundance in cashew plantations, forest edges, and forest interiors in Tillari Conservation Reserve, Maharashtra. Species composition of cashew plantations differed significantly from forests and was positively influenced by understorey and canopy cover. Cashew plantations had a near equal abundance of anurans as that of forest edges and interiors, which could be due to the preponderance of habitat generalists. Understorey positively influenced anuran abundance while ambient temperature had a negative influence. Reduced understorey and low canopy cover represent habitat modifications that occur in cashew plantations. Such structural changes could lead to reduced environmental refuges for anurans, thereby exposing them to large variations in temperature and moisture. Cashew plantations in Tillari Conservation Reserve serve as supplementary habitats for anurans. That said, cashew cultivation practices and markets must be understood before biodiversity‐friendly plantation practices are proposed.</p>},

Context
‘Conserving Nature’s stage’ has been advanced as an important conservation principle because of known links between biodiversity and abiotic environmental diversity, especially in sensitive high-latitude environments and at the landscape scale. However these links have not been examined across gradients of human impact on the landscape.

Objectives
To (1) analyze the relationships between land-use intensity and both landscape-scale biodiversity and geodiversity, and (2) assess the contributions of geodiversity, climate and spatial variables to explaining vascular plant species richness in landscapes of low, moderate and high human impact.

Methods
We used generalized additive models (GAMs) to analyze relationships between land-use intensity and both geodiversity (geological, geomorphological and hydrological richness) and plant species richness in 6191 1-km2 grid squares across Finland. We used linear regression-based variation partitioning (VP) to assess contributions of climate, geodiversity and spatial variable groups to accounting for spatial variation in species richness.

Results
In GAMs, geodiversity correlated negatively, and plant species richness positively, with land-use intensity. Both relationships were non-linear. In VP, geodiversity best accounted for species richness in areas of moderate to high human impact. These overall contributions were mainly due to variation explained jointly with climate, which dominated the models. Independent geodiversity contributions were highest in pristine environments, but low throughout.

Conclusions
Human action increases biodiversity but may reduce geodiversity, at landscape scale in high-latitude environments. Better understanding of the connections between biodiversity and abiotic environment along changing land-use gradients is essential in developing sustainable measures to conserve biodiversity under global change.},

   abstract = {Human activities continue to erode the tree of life, requiring us to prioritize research and conservation. Amphibians represent key victims and bellwethers of global change, and the need for action to conserve them is drastically outpacing knowledge. We provide a phylogeny incorporating nearly all extant amphibians (7,238 species). Current amphibian diversity is composed of both older, depauperate lineages and extensive, more recent tropical radiations found in select clades. Frog and salamander diversification increased strongly after the Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary, preceded by a potential mass-extinction event in salamanders. Diversification rates of subterranean caecilians varied little over time. Biogeographically, the Afro- and Neotropics harbour a particularly high proportion of Gondwanan relicts, comprising species with high evolutionary distinctiveness (ED). These high-ED species represent a large portion of the branches in the present tree: around 28% of all phylogenetic diversity comes from species in the top 10% of ED. The association between ED and imperilment is weak, but many species with high ED are now imperilled or lack formal threat status, suggesting opportunities for integrating evolutionary position and phylogenetic heritage in addressing the current extinction crisis. By providing a phylogenetic estimate for extant amphibians and identifying their threats and ED, we offer a preliminary basis for a quantitatively informed global approach to conserving the amphibian tree of life.},

   abstract = {Vocalizations are the most prominent signals in the communication of anuran amphibians. Frog calls can serve different roles depending on the social context. There are three categories of vocal signals (calls) based on social context. One of these is the aggressive call, which generally mediates interactions between conspecific males and conveys information about the level of aggression. In this study, we describe fighting calls elicited during physical combat between two males of Pithecopus ayeaye. We also analyzed aggressive calls not associated with physical combat, which were emitted by resident males from an established calling site toward approaching males, and discussed the variation related to different levels of aggression. The fighting call consists of one multi-pulsed note with an increment in sound amplitude throughout the note and amplitude peak by 96% of note duration. In general, fighting calls and aggressive calls have the same temporal envelope and spectral features. However, fighting calls exhibit a greater number of pulses, a higher pulse repetition rate, and a longer duration. The differences between aggressive calls of P. ayeaye produced in distinct contexts could indicate a graded signaling system in the aggressive calling behavior of the species. Our data match the pattern of escalated aggressive behavior occurring in other vocal anurans by modulating spectral and/or temporal features of their calls.},

This observation occurred during a rainy night in the Atlantic Forest region of northwest Paraná, Brazil. The multiple reproduction event involved four males (three of which were identified as satellites) and one female. Notable behaviors were recorded, including a vocalizing male assisting the female in folding leaves with his feet before depositing the eggs. The entire multiple reproduction event lasted about 40 minutes. Additionally, we observed a pair of P. tetraploidea engaging in axillary amplexus, where the male and female positioned their bellies toward each other. This amplexus lasted approximately 80 minutes, from their initial meeting until the eggs were deposited and they separated.

However, visual signaling can also be important in social interactions. We tested the hypothesis that open environments favor visual signals in a territorial defense context, in a nocturnal tree frog. We established three treatments each with eight males of Hypsiboas albomarginatus: (1) Clear Vision, with a mirror without visual obstacles; (2) Obstructed Vision, with half the mirror covered, and (3) Control, with mirror completely covered. We classified behavioral responses into orientation/locomotion, visual display, or acoustic signal. We calculated the mean emission rate per minute per behavior in each treatment and compared them among treatments using one-way ANOVA. Orientation and locomotion, visual display, and the advertisement call did not differ among treatments. However, the emission of aggressive calls in the Obstructed Vision treatment was significantly higher than in the Clear Vision treatment. The lowest rate of aggressive calls occurred in the Control. Thus, visual recognition of an intruder male was enough for resident males to adjust their rate of emission of acoustic aggressive signals, but not visual displays. Therefore, the recognition of the intruder male is not the only feature required for the evolution of visual signals in nocturnal tree frogs during agonistic interactions. This suggests that some visual displays may not be directly used for communication but rather constitute displacement activity.},

The database comprises 650 species and 39 families providing a unique opportunity to investigate ecological and evolutionary questions regarding antipredator mechanisms of anuran. We provide a general overview of geographic, taxonomic, and phylogenetic patterns found in the database. Both our studies and that of our colleagues added 70 species to the database.

More than 100 vertebrate predators were identified (in more than 200 reports) and classified as opportunistic, convenience, temporary specialized and specialized predators. Invertebrate predators were classified as solitary non‐venomous, venomous and social foragers according to 333 reviewed reports. Each of these categories of invertebrate predators was compared with the relative size of the anurans, showing an increase in the relative size of the prey when predators used special predatory tactics. The number of species and the number of families of anurans that were preyed upon did not vary with the size of the predator, suggesting that prey selection was not arbitrary and that energetic constraints must be involved in this choice. The relatively low predation pressure upon brachycephalids was related to the presence of some defensive strategies of its species. This compounding review can be used as the foundation for future advances in vertebrate predator–prey interactions.</p>},

   abstract = {In lek mating systems, sexual selection is thought to operate through two main mechanisms: endurance rivalry and female choice. We investigated the role of these mechanisms in explaining variation in male mating success in a typical lekking anuran, the Italian treefrog, Hyla intermedia. The results suggested that both chorus attendance and calling quality may affect male mating success, and that selection on these traits may indirectly result in selection for males with higher-than-average body condition. Both generalized linear models (GLM) and cubic-spline regressions (CSR) showed a monotonic relationship between mating success and chorus attendance, suggesting open-ended directional selection on male chorus tenure. GLMs on call acoustic properties showed a significant association of mating success with several highly intercorrelated call temporal properties (i.e. call rate, pulse rate and call duration), but not with call spectral properties. In both cases, however, CSRs provided evidence that the relationships of the call properties with mating success are unimodal, with peaks close to (spectral properties) or above (temporal properties) the population means. As often observed in anurans, chorus attendance explained much more variation in mating success than did calling quality. However, contrary to what is often assumed, we argue that the important role of endurance rivalry does not reduce, but rather emphasizes, the role of female choice in sexual selection.},

This study investigated the mating system and relevant social behavior of a temperate anuran (Rana chensinensis) at three localities in northern China. During chorusing, males aggregated and persisted in the communal spawning ponds with a density of 10–26 frogs per m2 water area and operational sex ratio of 15–28 males to 1 female. The males frequently grabbed any conspecifics they encountered, releasing the grip if the individual was a male, but holding the grip when it was a female. A significant positive relationship between male and female body lengths of pairs in amplexus was detected from all the sites during the five breeding seasons, but the average correlation coefficients of determination of 18% indicated that the size-assortative mating constituted a minority of the species’ mating system. Pairing probability decreased with increased size differences between sexes, which could have prevented a few adult animals in a population from forming pairs. The strong aggregation of males could limit the opportunities for large males to exhibit contest advantages in mating and for both sexes to choose a large mate. Infrequent occurrence of scramble competition (averaging 8% of the recorded amplectant pairs) and the lack of observed takeovers, probably because of reclusion of amplectant pairs at the bottom of spawning ponds, suggested a weak role of amplexus displacement in generating non-random mating. Our results suggest that although non-random mating with respect to body size may be expected in explosive breeders, the social environment characterized by male aggregation may also impose weak selective pressure for the evolution of non-random mating.},

Calling activity was spread throughout the annual cycle and there was no correlation between air temperature and calling activity.

Six male and two female call types were recorded from native ponds in the environs of Cape Town, South Africa. These include all call types previously recorded in the laboratory as well as one previously unidentified male call: chirping. The amount of calling and the number of call types increased as the breeding season progressed. Laboratory recordings indicated that all six male call types were directed to males; three of these were directed to both sexes and three were directed exclusively to males. Both female call types were directed exclusively to males. The predominant call type, in both field and laboratory recordings, was the male advertisement call. Sexual state affected male vocal behaviour. Male pairs in which at least one male was sexually active (gonadotropin injected) produced all call types, whereas pairs of uninjected males rarely called. Some call types were strongly associated with a specific behaviour and others were not. Clasped males always growled and clasping males typically produced amplectant calls or chirps; males not engaged in clasping most frequently advertised. The amount of advertising produced by one male was profoundly affected by the presence of another male. Pairing two sexually active males resulted in suppression of advertisement calling in one; suppression was released when males were isolated after pairing. Vocal dominance was achieved even in the absence of physical contact (clasping). We suggest that X. laevis males gain a reproductive advantage by competing for advertisement privileges and by vocally suppressing neighbouring males.},

   abstract = {This review focuses on the energetics of advertisement calls in frogs and insects (mostly ensiferans). I also review a number of methodological questions relating to the most appropriate ways to normalize metabolic rates for calling animals and to calculate efficiency of sound production

Although the mechanism of sound production is very different in these groups (vocalization vs. stridulation), net metabolic costs normalized to mass are similar among species producing the most conspicuous calls. Features of the call that interact to determine energetic cost include repetition rate, call duration, and intensity (sound pressure level). Anurans tend to produce louder (more intense) calls while ensiferans tend to produce sound during a greater proportion of the calling bout. All evidence suggests that advertisement calls are produced aerobically and the aerobic costs are similar or exceed the aerobic (but not necessarily total costs) of terrestrial locomotion

The pattern of radiated sound tends to be constant within a species and can be predicted to some degree from characteristics of an animal's acoustic radiator. Efficiency of sound production (acoustic power/net metabolic power) is low (0.05 to 6%) and variable when compared to locomotion (˜ 10–20%). From the present sample it appears that frogs are more efficient than ensiferans, but as more katydids are studied this trend may not hold. Of the factors that have been identified as determining efficiency the most important are the match between the size of the radiator and wavelength radiated, the absorption properties of the environment immediately around the animal, and the presence or absence of structures such as baffles and acoustic burrows},

What remains unknown is the relative costs of different defensive traits and how prey reconcile investment into these traits when energetically limited. We tested the simple allocation model of prey defense, which predicts an additive effect of increasing predation risk and resource availability, resulting in the full deployment of defensive traits under conditions of high risk and resource saturation. We collected morphometric, developmental, and behavioural data in an experiment using dragonfly larvae (predator) and Northern leopard frog tadpoles (prey) subject to variable levels of food availability and predation risk. Larvae exposed to food restriction showed limited response to predation risk; larvae at food saturation altered behaviour, development, and growth in response to predation risk. Responses to risk varied through time, suggesting ontogeny may affect the deployment of particular defensive traits. The observed negative correlation between body size and activity level for food-restricted prey – and the absence of a similar response among adequately-fed prey – suggests that a trade-off exists between behavioural and growth responses when energy budgets are limited. Our research is the first to demonstrate how investment into these defensive traits is mediated along gradients of both predation risk and resource availability over time. The interactions we demonstrate between resource availability and risk level on deployment of inducible defenses provide evidence that both internal condition and extrinsic risk factors play a critical role in the production of inducible defenses over time.},

Large tracks of primary forest can be (1) degraded by human-induced disturbance to the point of total conversion into alternative non-forest land-use types, or (2) reduced into small forest fragments isolated within an anthropogenic matrix. Such disturbed habitats are further prone to be colonized by disturbance-adapted species, which can offset species extinctions therein. Here we investigate amphibian and lizard responses to different degrees of habitat degradation and fragmentation, in terms of both species richness and composition, across the neotropics. We then partitioned the β-diversity into its species replacement and richness-difference components to further examine changes in amphibian and lizard species composition. Based on a comprehensive compilation of 67 studies, we observed increasing rates of amphibian and lizard species loss, particularly along the habitat degradation gradient. There were considerable shifts in species composition for both taxa at human-disturbed sites, which were compounded by species replacements. Novel environmental features of disturbed sites clearly benefited synanthropic generalists at the expense of strict forest habitat specialists. As such, we recommend avoiding the use of species richness as a single metric in evaluating the effects of habitat disturbance on biodiversity. Our findings further highlight the critical importance of retaining large expanses of relatively undisturbed forest within anthropogenic landscapes to prevent pervasive species losses and changes in community structure.},

Here we evaluated lizard responses to changes in landscape, habitat patch, and quality in a deforestation frontier in southwestern Brazilian Amazonia. We first considered overall lizard assemblages and then two species subgroups of contrasting thermoregulation strategies. We sampled lizards at 21 forest patches (42–7,035 ha) subject to moderate habitat disturbance (e.g., cattle intrusion and selective logging). Based on 6,000 pitfall trap-days and 60,000 m of visual surveys, we recorded 215 individuals representing 15 species. Contrary to expectations, species richness and abundance were not explained by any of the variables considered, including matrix quality, proportion of forest cover, forest patch area and shape, age since isolation, arthropod biomass, canopy openness, litter volume, tree density, and fire history. However, the composition of persisting species was determined by the structural complexity of the adjacent matrix. The abundance of species that avoid direct sun exposure to regulate their body temperature increased under more-complex structures of adjacent matrix areas and decreased within patches more intensively affected by past fire events. Disturbance within forest patches likely decreased the patch-matrix contrast, contributing to the absence of forest area effects. Nevertheless, species-specific microhabitat requirements dictated part of the lizard species that were able to persist in the fragmented landscape. Strategies aiming to maximize lizard diversity should embrace retention of the habitat quality within forest patches and forest corridors/high-stature vegetation in at least some sites connecting forest remnants.},

Using predictive frameworks to examine biodiversity responses to logging could assist in retaining natural forest values. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) and the habitat accommodation model (HAM) potentially offer frameworks for explaining different coarse scale community responses to logging. We used a 60 year post-logging chronosequence to investigate small reptile community responses to age post-logging in temperate forests using three metrics (species richness, evenness and relative abundance). First, we evaluated if variation in these metrics adhered to prior predictions, including the IDH. Second, we evaluated how age post-logging influence community responses through fine scale vegetation elements. Third, we evaluated support for the HAM by measuring compositional change (species turnover) of small reptile community to age post-logging. Reptile relative abundance exhibited a curvilinear relationship to age since logging, contradicting our prior prediction of sustained increase. Species richness and evenness were unrelated to age since logging thus providing no support to IDH and other prior predictions. Relative abundance and richness did not relate to any vegetation characteristic tested. These metrics were also unrelated to logging method. Community composition was marginally significantly influenced by age since logging, thus supporting the HAM. Our results suggest that forest reptiles exposed to logging exhibit variable changes depending on the community metric in question, and that different approaches, including those based on species traits, are needed to improve evaluating disturbance related biodiversity responses.},

If we prioritize savanna restoration, we should ask how savanna animal communities differ from communities in related open habitats and forests. We documented distribution of amphibian and reptile species across an open-savanna–forest gradient in the Midwest U.S. to determine how fire history and habitat structure affected herpetofaunal community composition. The transition from open habitats to forests was a transition from higher reptile abundance to higher amphibian abundance and the intermediate savanna landscape supported the most species overall. These differences warn against assuming that amphibian and reptile communities will have similar ecological responses to habitat structure. Richness and abundance also often responded in opposite directions to some habitat characteristics, such as cover of bare ground or litter. Herpetofaunal community species composition changed along a fire gradient from infrequent and recent fires to frequent but less recent fires. Nearby (200-m) wetland cover was relatively unimportant in predicting overall herpetofaunal community composition while fire history and fire-related canopy and ground cover were more important predictors of composition, diversity, and abundance. Increased developed cover was negatively related to richness and abundance. This indicates the importance of fire history and fire related landscape characteristics, and the negative effects of development, in shaping the upland herpetofaunal community along the native grassland–forest continuum.},

However, arbitrary decisions during the model-building process can affect predictions and contribute to uncertainty about where suitable climate space will exist. For many species, the key climatic factors limiting distributions are unknown. This paper assesses the uncertainty generated by using different climate predictor variable sets for modelling the impacts of climate change.

Location Europe, 10° W to 50° E and 30° N to 60° N.

Methods Using 1453 presence pixels at 30 arcsec resolution for the great bustard (Otis tarda), predictions of future distribution were made based on two emissions scenarios, three general climate models and 26 sets of predictor variables. Twenty-six current models were created, and 156 for both 2050 and 2080. Map comparison techniques were used to compare predictions in terms of the quantity and the location of presences (map comparison kappa, MCK) and using a range change index (RCI). Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to partition explained deviance in MCK and RCI among sources of uncertainty.

Results The 26 different variable sets achieved high values of AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and yet introduced substantial variation into maps of current distribution. Differences between maps were even greater when distributions were projected into the future. Some 64–78% of the variation between future maps was attributable to choice of predictor variable set alone. Choice of general climate model and emissions scenario contributed a maximum of 15% variation and their order of importance differed for MCK and RCI.

Main conclusions Generalized variable sets produce an unmanageable level of uncertainty in species distribution models which cannot be ignored. The use of sound ecological theory and statistical methods to check predictor variables can reduce this uncertainty, but our knowledge of species may be too limited to make more than arbitrary choices. When all sources of modelling uncertainty are considered together, it is doubtful whether ensemble methods offer an adequate solution. Future studies should explicitly acknowledge uncertainty due to arbitrary choices in the model-building process and develop ways to convey the results to decision-makers.},

The amphibian faunas of seven such fragments varying in size from 0.16 to 1250 ha were examined. Twenty-eight amphibian species of two families (Ranidae and Microhylidae) were recorded in the rainforest fragments. The species numbers in the fragments were positively correlated with fragment area and form nested subsets. Composition and individual frequency in small fragments differed from that of the control site (1250 ha). The relative individual density (individuals found each searching hour) was negatively correlated with the fragment size. This is probably due to the fact that the density of streams and brooks was higher in small fragments, which also explains why smaller fragments contained a larger proportion of brook-dwelling amphibian species than larger fragments. Species that live far from water and show a reproduction strategy independent of running waters or ponds, such as certain microhylids, were only present in fragments of 30 ha or more. The more common species in the control site were also found in the majority of fragments. A rainforest remnant of 1250 ha seems to be large enough to contain a large part of the original amphibian fauna, provided that there are suitable microhabitats. Compared to other taxa, amphibians generally seem to react less sensitively to fragmentation. Due to the sensitivity to microclimate changes microhylids and certain species of the subfamily of Mantellinae represent good bioindicators.},

   abstract = {Aim
Habitat split isolates forest fragments where terrestrial adults of many amphibian species live from aquatic-breeding sites where their larvae develop, causing population declines and shifts in community structure. In contrast to most fragmentation theoretical frameworks which point to the relevance of fragment area and isolation, a recent theoretical model predicts that split distance, defined as the shortest distance between a forest fragment edge and the nearby stream, should affect negatively the abundance and occurrence probability of populations in forest fragments and, consequently, their total abundance and species richness. The model further predicts that the quality of the matrix between the two habitats, called split matrix, will modulate such responses. Here, we provide the first test of these theoretical predictions.

Location
Atlantic Forest, Brazil.

Methods
Split distance was estimated for all fragments of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a highly disturbed biodiversity hotspot. Then, we selected 23 forest fragments, within a 1166-km2 landscape, in a design that insured orthogonality between split distance (0–2000 m) and fragment size (1.7–30 ha). Split matrix quality (SMQ) and proximity, a measure of the availability of forest around the focal fragment, were estimated and controlled for in the analyses. Using multiple regression analyses with control for spatial autocorrelation, and AIC multimodel inference, we evaluated the relative importance of split distance, SMQ, fragment size and proximity to determine amphibian community and population attributes.

Results
Most Atlantic Forest fragments were affected by habitat split. Consistent with the theoretical predictions, species richness, abundance and the occurrence probability of many species declined with split distance and increased with SMQ, even when controlling for fragment size and isolation.

Main conclusions
Split distance can be used as a surrogate for conservation value of forest fragments for aquatic-breeding amphibians in landscape planning and restoration enterprises.},

   abstract = {<p> Population persistence often depends on functional connectivity for animals that transit multiple vegetation types to acquire resources, particularly for dispersers navigating a landscape matrix fragmented by agriculture, forestry, or urbanization. For many pool‐breeding amphibians, population viability depends on the ability of juveniles to locate and reach suitable habitat in the terrestrial matrix. Thus, identifying the scale and orientation of movements is necessary to predict the consequences of landscape configuration for populations. We conducted three experiments to evaluate if different vegetation types alter the behavior of post‐metamorphic wood frogs ( <italic>Lithobates sylvaticus</italic> ). We measured the: (1) fine‐scale movement (velocity, latency, path length, net displacement, path tortuosity, and orientation) of individuals ( <italic>n</italic>  = 150) released on five substrates (asphalt, corn, forest leaf litter, hay, lawn); (2) directionality of frogs ( <italic>n</italic>  = 168) released at different distances from forest in two open‐cover types (lawns, hayfields); and (3) willingness of frogs ( <italic>n</italic>  = 240) to enter three land‐cover types (asphalt, lawn, forest) when released within artificial refugia islands at different distances from forest. Using fluorescent powder, we mapped 318 movement paths and performance differed. Frogs demonstrated straighter paths, and greater net movements, path lengths, and velocities through treatments with lower structural complexity (asphalt &gt; lawn &gt; corn &gt; forest leaf litter &gt; hay). Frogs also exhibited forest‐oriented directionality in asphalt, lawn, and corn but random orientation in forest control and hay. The willingness of individuals to leave a refugia island was lowest on asphalt (12% of released frogs), moderate on lawn (40%), and very high in forest (90%). Overall, results indicate that the quality of nonforest matrix may influence the ability of frogs to traverse open cover and orient toward forest from distances of ≥40–55 m. Thus, it is inaccurate to assume movement performance is uniform across all open‐matrix types, an important distinction because many landscape‐population models use expert‐based values that are a one‐size‐fits‐all measure for open cover. Our study provides field‐based, mechanistic approximations of juvenile movement that can be useful for predicting how matrix composition and configuration might be managed to maintain or restore functional connectivity. </p>},

   abstract = {We examined the effect of body size on locomotor performance and movement behavior in early postmetamorphic toadlets of Fowler's Toad (Anaxyrus fowleri). Dispersal, if strictly density dependent, should be favored among the relatively small toadlets that emerge from crowded growth conditions, but not among the relatively large toadlets that result from low-density conditions; however, smaller toadlets may have less physical capability to disperse than larger toadlets. The net result may thus be that actual dispersal probability is greatest among intermediate-sized toadlets. Using toadlets of various sizes purposefully raised by manipulating their densities as tadpoles, we tested toadlet locomotor jumping endurance in relation to body size. We also compared the animals' initial body size against their overall movements in the wild, determined using capture–recapture methods, over 2 yr as they grew from toadlets to adults. We calculated movement rate and dispersal probability for each individual recaptured more than twice and determined whether successful movement strategies were correlated or uncorrelated. Our results show that toadlets of intermediate size are most likely to disperse farthest, even though they do not necessarily exhibit the highest levels of endurance. Therefore, knowledge of individual life experience across multiple life stages may be necessary to understand dispersal tendencies in amphibians and may be required in future studies aiming to predict dispersal and population dynamics.},

Aim
Faced with the dispute regarding spatial gradients of body size in ectotherms, we build upon their long-known allometric relationship with water economy, which scales with thermal and hydric regimes, to revisit and refine the water conservation hypothesis (WCH). We provide a brief description of the WCH, including its physiological basis and geographical predictions for body size clines in terrestrial amphibians, and test it against heat-based hypotheses in four amphibian clades.

Location
The Americas.

Methods
We employ phylogenetic comparative analyses to examine relationships between body size and both temperature, as a descriptor of the effect of heat alone, and potential evapotranspiration, which describes the water constraint along evaporative gradients. We assess these relationships in four amphibian clades: the subfamily of leaf frogs (Phyllomedusinae), genera of gladiator frogs (Hypsiboas), salamanders (Plethodon) and the family of glass frogs (Centrolenidae).

Results
Three clades did not show phylogenetic signals in body size variation. In addition, three clades showed a positive relationship with potential evapotranspiration as predicted, and all of them were unrelated to temperature. When present, however, the explanatory power of evaporative energy on body size variation was relatively weak.

Main conclusions
The conservation of water across evaporative gradients is both a more comprehensive explanation and a more pervasive driver of spatial clines in body size among terrestrial amphibians than is the balance of heat alone. However, the relatively low predictive ability of evaporative energy and its dependence on specific climatic configurations both emphasize and elucidate the non-universality of the phenomenon.},

   abstract = {Amphibian species richness increases toward the equator, particularly in humid tropical forests. This relation between amphibian species richness and environmental water availability has been proposed to be a consequence of their high rates of evaporative water loss. In this way, traits that estimate water balance are expected to covary with climate and constrain a species’ geographic distribution. Furthermore, we predicted that coexisting species of anurans would have traits that are adapted to local hydric conditions. We compared the traits that describe water balance in 17 species of anurans that occur in the mesic Atlantic Forest and xeric Cerrado (savannah) habitats of Brazil. We predicted that species found in the warmer and dryer areas would show a lower sensitivity of locomotor performance to dehydration (SLPD), increased resistance to evaporative water loss (REWL) and higher rates of water uptake (RWU) than species restricted to the more mesic areas. We estimated the allometric relations between the hydric traits and body mass using phylogenetic generalized least squares. These regressions showed that REWL scaled negatively with body mass, whereas RWU scaled positively with body mass. Additionally, species inhabiting areas characterized by higher and more seasonally uniform temperatures, and lower and more seasonally concentrated precipitation, such as the Cerrado, had higher RWU and SLPD than species with geographical distributions more restricted to mesic environments, such as the Atlantic Forest. These results support the hypothesis that the interspecific variation of physiological traits shows an adaptation pattern to abiotic environmental traits.},

   abstract = {Despite a recent increase of information on leaf litter frog communities from Atlantic rainforests, few studies have analyzed the relationship between environmental parameters and community structure of these animals. We analyzed the effects of some environmental factors on a leaf litter frog community at an Atlantic Rainforest area in southeastern Brazil. Data collection lasted ten consecutive days in January 2010, at elevations ranging between 300 and 520 m above sea level. We established 50 quadrats of 5 x 5 m on the forest floor, totaling 1,250 m² of sampled area, and recorded the mean leaf-litter depth and the number of trees within the plot, as well as altitude. We found 307 individuals belonging to ten frog species within the plots. The overall density of leaf-litter frogs estimated from the plots was 24.6 ind/100m², with Euparkerella brasiliensis (Parker, 1926), Ischnocnema guentheri (Steindachner, 1864), Ischnocnema parva (Girard, 1853) and Haddadus binotatus (Spix, 1824) presenting the highest estimated densities. Among the environmental variables analyzed, only altitude influenced the parameters of anuran community. Our results indicate that the study area has a very high density of forest floor leaf litter frogs at altitudes of 300-500 m. Future estimates of litter frog density might benefit from taking the local altitudinal variation into consideration. Neglecting such variation might result in underestimated/overestimated values if they are extrapolated to the whole area.},

Oviposition occurred 86–98 days after of the frst copulation. Females lay clutches of 7–14
eggs. Juvenile coloration is remarkably different from adults. Newborns have a dorsum
with transverse brown or gray bands, and white or pale gray interspaces; young of 1–2
years have green bands and yellow-green interspaces; adults have dark green bands.
Ontogenetic color changes are presumably associated with antipredator strategies, change

All species in this assemblage change the type and size of prey as they grow. An ordination of diet composition was significantly associated with frog size and species-specific behaviour. However, a partial Mantel analysis indicated that species explained about 1.5 times more of the variation in diet overlap between individuals than frog size. Diet and foraging activity are correlated in juveniles, but not in adults, and this result holds whether species are considered as statistically independent observations or whether relationships are analysed using phylogenetically independent contrasts. This study showed that the partitioning of food resources between species changes with the population size structures. Thus, intraspecific and interspecific changes in diet, coupled with different patterns of juvenile recruitment, cause diet segregation among species due to temporal segregation of equivalent size classes.},

I sampled 50 randomly located 25 m <sup>2</sup> litter plots in each area during the wet and dry seasons in 1997. Ten anuran, five lizard, and three snake species were captured in plots over the study. Assemblage composition was most similar at logged and unlogged sites. The logged forest herpetofauna had higher species richness and abundance than the unlogged forest, but diversity was greater in the unlogged forest due to greater evenness. In contrast, the pine plantation site had the highest richness, abundance, and evenness of the three study sites, but species composition was distinct from the other areas. Herpetofaunal densities were significantly lower in all three areas during the dry season than in the wet season. During the dry season, soil moisture, litter mass, topography, shrub cover, and number of fallen logs were significant positive predictors of herpetofaunal presence in litter plots, but only soil moisture was significant in the wet season. The interaction of moisture and topography appears to be important in determining seasonal patterns of litter herpetofaunal distribution. Comparison of litter herpetofaunal studies across the tropics have shown that mid‐elevation faunas generally support fewer species than lowland faunas. Compared with other tropical mid‐elevation litter faunas, Kibale supports an intermediate number of species, but at lower densities than observed at any other mid‐elevation site reported in the literature. </p>},

The changes occurring in the reproductive strategies of anurans are a combinations of morphological, physiological and behavioral features adapted to environmental conditions. The objective of this paper was to register the abundance, biometric variation, macro and microenvironmental occupation and reproductive aspects of Hypsiboas semilineatus in a permanent lotic water body in the Reserva Biológica de Saltinho, a remnant of the Atlantic Forest, located in the southern of the State of Pernambuco, Northeast Brazil. The observations in the lotic water body were made through active collecting. The sampling was performed twice a month from 18h to 22h, between October 2009 and March 2010. We observed the location and abundance of macro and microenvironmental individuals which had their biometry measures, height above the water surface and distance from the edge of the pond recorded. During the eight months of sampling we recorded 31 specimens, all adults, with an average size of 45 mm ranging from 30 to 51 mm. As the spatial distribution we observed the specimens occupying especially herbaceous plants, males vocalizing specifically on stems and also on leaves, and those that were not in calling activity, such as satellite males and females were seen only on leaves. Regarding to the vertical distribution the specimens preference were between 40,1 and 60 cm (n = 13) (p = 0,002) and in horizontal distribution the preference was 1 meter away from the border of the water body (n = 24) (p = 0,001). The vegetation structure had a significant influence on the abundance and the spatial distribution of Hypsiboas semilineatus as well as their reproductive activity, because it gives available sites to be disputed and this enables the structure of the population. It is necessary to conduct longer studies on the ecological aspects of Hypsiboas semilineatus because they generate elements for the formulation of more efficient management plans for conserving this species and the ecosystems where they live.},

Herein, we show the reproductive pattern and data on population structure of this species from two sites, using standardized sample methods (visual and auditory surveys), during three rainy seasons. The higher number of males in calling activity was detected in the beginning of the rainy season. However, sporadic male calls were also heard in the dry season. Females were significantly larger than males, and males captured at the end of the rainy season were larger than those captured in other periods. Females with eggs visible through the abdominal wall were found in all samplings at one site, but a larger number of juveniles were found at the end of the rainy season. The size of juveniles was variable and the smallest individuals were found at the end of the rainy season. According to nocturnal visual surveys males were significantly more abundant than females (1.9:1 adult sex ratio). According to data collected on gravid female occurrence, juvenile number variation, and presence of calling males, we suggest that P. aff. fenestratus reproduces during the rainy season showing marked seasonality.},

   abstract = {The species of the Leptodactylus fuscus group and those of the genus Adenomera lay their eggs in underground chambers. According to current systematic arrangement of these genera, this behaviour is convergent. Here we describe reproduction, courtship, tadpole morphology, calls, chamber structure, and populational phenology of an Adenomera species, and compare some of these features with those of other species of the genus and with species of Leptodactylus of the fuscus and pentadactylus groups. We tested the tadpoles of the Adenomera sp. and those of Leptodactylus labyrinthicus (pentadactylus group) for their foam‐making abilities. There was sexual dimorphism in size; males averaged 22.0 mm and females 24.3 mm in snout–vent length. Males called from late September to late February; calling often began about 2–3 h before sunset. Males called exclusively in open (non‐forest) areas. Egg clutches were found around male calling sites. Males excavated spherical chambers which had a direct entrance. During mating, the male led the female towards a previously excavated chamber. Territorial interactions (aggressive calls and fights) occurred when an intruder male approached a calling male. Late‐stage tadpoles and newly metamorphosed juveniles were found within underground chambers. Clutch size averaged 10.6; eggs averaged 3.7 mm in diameter and were cream coloured. Tadpoles had horny beaks, but no labial tooth; spiracle was present. All tested groups of tadpoles generated foam within 10 h. As we report for Adenomera sp., the males of Leptodactylus species of the fuscus group lead the female to a previously excavated chamber. Tadpole foam‐making behaviour was reported in Leptodactylus of the fuscus group and was previously unknown for any species of Adenomera or for Leptodactylus of the pentadactylus group. The way in which the tadpoles of Adenomera sp., Leptodactylus spp. (of the fuscus group) and L. labyrinthicus made foam was quite similar. The foam‐making behaviour of the studied tadpoles may act to avoid compaction of the tadpoles at the bottom of the basin or underground chamber, avoiding overcrowding and increasing respiratory and excretory efficiency. As presently recognized, the phylogenetic position of Adenomera suggests that reproductive major behavioural features are convergent with some Leptodactylus species. Alternatively, our data point to close phylogenetic relationships between Adenomera and Leptodactylus of the fuscus and pentadactylus groups, reinforcing the paraphyletic nature of the genus Leptodactylus.},

   abstract = {Background
Traditionally, the evolution of terrestrial reproduction in anurans from ancestors that bred in water has been accepted in the literature. Still, the existence of intermediate stages of water dependency, such as species that lay eggs close to water (e.g., in burrows) instead of in bodies of water, supports the hypothesis of an ordered and gradual evolution in the direction of a more terrestrial form of reproduction. However, this conventional view has recently been challenged for some anurans groups. Leptodactylinae frogs are a remarkable example of anurans with an outstanding diversity in terms of reproductive features, with distinct water dependency among lineages. Here, we tested the hypothesis of a gradual and ordered tendency towards terrestriality in Leptodactylinae, including the existence of obligatory intermediate stages, such as semi-terrestrial reproductive strategies. We also addressed the association between reproductive modes and the morphological and ecological features.

Results
An ancestral reconstruction analysis indicated that even though shifts from aquatic to terrestrial breeding occurred throughout the history of Leptodactylus and Adenomera, shifts from terrestrial to aquatic reproduction happened at almost the same frequency. Our results also demonstrated that reproductive modes for semi-terrestrial tadpoles were not necessarily an intermediate form between aquatic and terrestrial breeds. Correlations among reproductive modes and other life-history traits suggested that tadpole environment, clutch size, nuptial spines, and egg pigmentation were co-evolving and driven by water dependency.

Conclusions
Our results found no evidence of evolutionary tendencies toward terrestriality in Leptodactylinae. We found reversals from terrestrial to aquatic tadpole development and no evidence of obligatory intermediate stages, such as semi-terrestrial reproductive strategies. We also found correlations between reproductive modes and other life-history traits driven by water dependence. Aquatic reproductive modes are associated with higher clutch sizes, lentic waters, and the presence of nuptial spines and egg pigmentation.},

Calling activity began before the start of the rainy season and lasted from November to April; vocalization activity was not correlated with the amount of rainfall. Reproductive males called on a variety of substrates close to or in permanent or temporary water bodies, during both day and night. Male behavior at high and low densities, calling sites occupancy and reproductive period indicate an unusual explosive breeding pattern for the species. Rhinella hoogmoedi presented a multi-pulsed call, composed of pulse group calls, similar to Rhinella paraguayensis, Rhinella castaneotica, Rhinella martyi, populations of Rhinella gr. margaritifera from Bolivia, Rhinella margaritifera from French Guyana, and Rhinella gr. margaritifera from Cusco, Peru. Acoustic parameters such as call duration, number of pulse groups per call, number of calls per minute, note duration, number of notes per minute, pulse rate, dominant frequency, and amplitude modulation types of call, were good parameters to discriminate among the species of the Rhinella margaritifera group, as in the members of the Bufonidae family. New descriptions of complete advertisement calls and molecular studies will help elucidate taxonomic, biogeographic, and phylogenic patterns for this complex of species.},

   abstract = {Edge effects are thought to play a key role in fragmented habitats. It is often assumed that edge-avoiding species are more prone to local extinction than non-edge-avoiding species, but there are few data to support this assumption. Also, few data are available on the effects of edges on some groups, and there is little understanding of seasonal changes in edge effect intensity. To better understand the role that edge effects play in fragmented tropical forests, we assessed the distribution of reptiles and amphibians in six littoral rainforest fragments in southeastern Madagascar in 1999 (dry season) and 2000 (wet season). Using randomization tests, we found all three types of edge responses: edge-avoiders, interior-avoiders, and omnipresent species. However, edge responses varied considerably among seasons. For example, some species (e.g., Mantidactylus bicalcaratus, Phelsuma quadriocellata) were strong edge-avoiders in the dry season, but showed no preference for edge or interior habitats during the wet season. Also, edge-avoiding species tended to be more extinction-prone than non-edge-avoiding species. Abiotic data documented significantly higher temperatures and dew point temperatures near edges. Wind speed also tended to be higher and relative humidity tended to be lower near edges. Our results indicate that many amphibians and reptiles respond to altered microclimates near edges and these responses have a strong seasonal component. For many species, edge sensitivity does seem to be correlated with extinction vulnerability and therefore should be of primary consideration in plans to conserve biodiversity in fragmented tropical forests.},

   abstract = {Context
Although amphibian distributions are associated with environmental moisture at global and local scales, less is known about how desiccation tolerance influences landscape distributions of amphibians.

Objectives
We evaluated two hypotheses linking amphibian distributions in a fragmented tropical forest landscape to desiccation risk. The patch quality hypothesis predicts that desiccation-prone species are absent on small forest patches, which are generally warmer and drier than large patches. Alternatively, the matrix effects hypothesis suggests that desiccation-prone species are absent on isolated forest patches surrounded by open savanna because they will be unable to traverse the matrix in which patches occur.

Methods
We quantified interspecific variation in desiccation proneness using field-based desiccation trials, and tested for associations between desiccation proneness and distributions of amphibians in fragmented forest in northeastern Bolivia.

Results
Rates of evaporative water loss were negatively associated with an index of dispersal limitation, but unrelated to species’ area requirements.

Conclusions
By demonstrating that desiccation-prone species do not occur on isolated forest patches, we provide clear support for the matrix effects hypothesis. We suggest that desiccation proneness is a key trait that may determine amphibian responses to a range of global change drivers, including habitat loss and fragmentation, invasive species, and climate change.},

In this study we investigated whether rates of dehydration and rehydration are able to explain the spatial distribution of an anuran community in a Restinga environment at the northern coast of the State of Bahia, Brazil, represented by 11 species distributed in 27 sample units. The environmental data set containing 20 variables was reduced to a few synthetic axes by principal component analysis (PCA). Physiological variables measured were rates of dehydration, rehydration from water, and rehydration from a neutral substrate. Multiple regression analyses were used to test the null hypothesis of no association between the environmental data set (synthetic axes of PCA) and each axis representative of a physiological variable, which was rejected (P < 0.001). Of 15 possible partial regressions only rehydration rate from neutral substrate vs. PC1 and PC2, rehydration rate from water vs. PC1, and dehydration rate vs. PC2 were significant. Our analysis was influenced by a gradient between two different groups of sample units: a beach area with high density of bromeliads and an environment without bodies of water with low density of bromeliads. Species of very specific natural history and morphological characters occur in these environments: Phyllodytes melanomystax and Scinax auratus, species frequently occurring in terrestrial bromeliads, and Ischnocnema paulodutrai, common along the northern coast of Bahia and usually found in forest remnants within environments with low number of bodies of water. In dry environments species with lower rates of dehydration were dominant, whereas species showing greater rates of dehydration were found predominantly in microhabitats with greater moisture or abundance of bodies of water.},

   abstract = {Aim
We analysed elevational and microclimatic drivers of thermal tolerance diversity in a tropical mountain frog clade to test three macrophysiological predictions: less spatial variation in upper than lower thermal limits (Bretts’ heat-invariant hypothesis); narrower thermal tolerance ranges in habitats with less variation in temperature (Janzen's climatic variability hypothesis); and higher level of heat impacts at lower elevations.

Location
Forest and open habitats through a 4,230-m elevational gradient across the tropical Andes of Ecuador.

Method
We examined variability in critical thermal limits (CTmax and CTmin) and thermal breadth (TB; CTmax–CTmin) in 21 species of Pristimantis frogs. Additionally, we monitored maximum and minimum temperatures at the local scale (tmax, tmin) and estimated vulnerability to acute thermal stress from heat (CTmax–tmax) and cold (tmin–CTmin), by partitioning thermal diversity into elevational and microclimatic variation.

Results
Our results were consistent with Brett's hypothesis: elevation promotes more variation in CTmin and tmin than in CTmax and tmax. Frogs inhabiting thermally variable open habitats have higher CTmax and tmax and greater TBs than species restricted to forest habitats, which show less climatic overlap across the elevational gradient (Janzen's hypothesis). Vulnerability to heat stress was higher in open than forest habitats and did not vary with elevation.

Main conclusions
We suggest a mechanistic explanation of thermal tolerance diversity in elevational gradients by including microclimatic thermal variation. We propose that the unfeasibility to buffer minimum temperatures locally may explain the rapid increase in cold tolerance (lower CTmin) with elevation. In contrast, the relative invariability in heat tolerance (CTmax) with elevation may revolve around the organisms’ habitat selection of open- and canopy-buffered habitats. Secondly, on the basis of microclimatic estimates, lowland and upland species may be equally vulnerable to temperature increase, which is contrary to the pattern inferred from regional interpolated climate estimators.},

In this study we analyse the relationship between local seasonal patterns of abundance within the anuran community of the Monte Zerpa Cloud Forest, Mérida Mountain Range (Cordillera de Mérida), in the Venezuelan Andes. We hypothesized that variation in precipitation, temperature, and relative humidity affects the temporal abundance patterns of anurans. Data collection was performed through nocturnal biweekly inspections from 2002 to 2003. Air temperature, relative humidity, and monthly precipitation were considered as variables of climatic seasonality. Generalized linear models were used to evaluate the effect of climatic variables on anuran abundance across seasons. Overall, 542 individuals and four anuran species were recorded in stream tributaries only. The local anuran community was comprised of Hyalinobatrachium duranti, Hyloscirtus platydactylus, Hyloscirtus jahni, and Pristimantis vanadisae. The most abundant species were H. duranti (288 individuals) and H. platydactylus (145 individuals), representing 53% and 27% of the total anuran abundance, respectively. Differences in abundance between species were observed. Although the total abundance of anurans was higher during the low precipitation season, no significant differences between the two seasons were detected. The variation in anuran abundance was explained by relative humidity and temperature. Our results suggest that the highest abundance of anurans can be expected when temperatures reach favourable levels (15-17°C), relative humidity increases, and precipitation remains constant.},

Herpetofaunal densities were significantly lower in all three areas during the dry season than in the wet season. During the dry season, soil moisture, litter mass, topography, shrub cover, and number of fallen logs were significant positive predictors of herpetofaunal presence in litter plots, but only soil moisture was significant in the wet season. The interaction of moisture and topography appears to be important in determining seasonal patterns of litter herpetofaunal distribution. Comparison of litter herpetofaunal studies across the tropics have shown that mid‐elevation faunas generally support fewer species than lowland faunas. Compared with other tropical mid‐elevation litter faunas, Kibale supports an intermediate number of species, but at lower densities than observed at any other mid‐elevation site reported in the literature. </p>},

According to current systematic arrangement of these genera, this behaviour is convergent. Here we describe reproduction, courtship, tadpole morphology, calls, chamber structure, and populational phenology of an Adenomera species, and compare some of these features with those of other species of the genus and with species of Leptodactylus of the fuscus and pentadactylus groups. We tested the tadpoles of the Adenomera sp. and those of Leptodactylus labyrinthicus (pentadactylus group) for their foam‐making abilities. There was sexual dimorphism in size; males averaged 22.0 mm and females 24.3 mm in snout–vent length. Males called from late September to late February; calling often began about 2–3 h before sunset. Males called exclusively in open (non‐forest) areas. Egg clutches were found around male calling sites. Males excavated spherical chambers which had a direct entrance. During mating, the male led the female towards a previously excavated chamber. Territorial interactions (aggressive calls and fights) occurred when an intruder male approached a calling male. Late‐stage tadpoles and newly metamorphosed juveniles were found within underground chambers. Clutch size averaged 10.6; eggs averaged 3.7 mm in diameter and were cream coloured. Tadpoles had horny beaks, but no labial tooth; spiracle was present. All tested groups of tadpoles generated foam within 10 h. As we report for Adenomera sp., the males of Leptodactylus species of the fuscus group lead the female to a previously excavated chamber. Tadpole foam‐making behaviour was reported in Leptodactylus of the fuscus group and was previously unknown for any species of Adenomera or for Leptodactylus of the pentadactylus group. The way in which the tadpoles of Adenomera sp., Leptodactylus spp. (of the fuscus group) and L. labyrinthicus made foam was quite similar. The foam‐making behaviour of the studied tadpoles may act to avoid compaction of the tadpoles at the bottom of the basin or underground chamber, avoiding overcrowding and increasing respiratory and excretory efficiency. As presently recognized, the phylogenetic position of Adenomera suggests that reproductive major behavioural features are convergent with some Leptodactylus species. Alternatively, our data point to close phylogenetic relationships between Adenomera and Leptodactylus of the fuscus and pentadactylus groups, reinforcing the paraphyletic nature of the genus Leptodactylus.},

   abstract = {The Amazon Basin, representing the largest expanse of intact tropical rain forest on the planet, harbors the largest diversity of amphibians and reptiles in the world.
Limited elevation and climate differences across the Basin belie one major division of upland forests – geomorphological soil age and induced nutrient levels. We
hypothesized that secondary consumers in the leaf litter herpetofauna community on ancient soils of Central Amazonia would exhibit reduced biomass compared with
those found on younger soils of Western Amazonia, and that population densities on ancient soils could be driven below viable thresholds, reducing species richness.
We found overall herpetofauna abundance, biomass and richness on young soils in Ecuador were significantly greater than those on ancient soils in the Brazilian
Amazon. Separately, amphibians were only slightly more abundant, but their biomass on younger soils was twice that on ancient soils. Even more impressive was the
variation exhibited by lizards: abundance was not significantly different, but biomass was five times greater on younger soils. Diversity of both taxa was greater on young
soils. The most important driver of differences in herpetofauna biomass, abundance and possibly diversity across Amazonia may be the underlying geomorphologic
differences. Reduced primary productivity on ancient soils appears to reverberate up the food chain, leaving fewer resources for higher trophic levels. We suggest that
conservation initiatives must compensate for reduced biomass on ancient soils through increased reserve size, especially as forest fragmentation escalates. This study
highlights the importance of including biomass as a standard measure in herpetofauna sampling.},

Recent studies have accounted for some of this heterogeneity through a positive association between canopy cover and Bd abundance, which is attributed to the cooling effect of canopy cover. We questioned whether leaf litter inputs that are also associated with canopy cover might also alter Bd growth. Leaf litter inputs exhibit tremendous interspecific chemical variation, and we hypothesized that Bd growth varies with leachate chemistry. We also hypothesized that Bd uses leaf litter as a growth substrate. To test these hypotheses, we conducted laboratory trials in which we exposed cultures of Bd to leachate of 12 temperate leaf litter species at varying dilutions. Using a subset of those 12 litter species, we also exposed Bd to pre-leached litter substrate. We found that exposure to litter leachate and substrate reduced Bd spore and sporangia densities, although there was substantial variation among treatments. In particular, Bd densities were inversely correlated with concentrations of phenolic acids. We conducted a field survey of phenolic concentrations in natural wetlands which verified that the leachate concentrations in our lab study are ecologically relevant. Our study reinforces prior indications that positive associations between canopy cover and Bd abundance are likely mediated by water temperature effects, but this phenomenon might be counteracted by changes in aquatic chemistry from leaf litter inputs.},

The effects of forest fragmentation on the composition of anuran assemblages are so far poorly known. We studied the joint influence of forest fragmentation and degradation on leaf‐litter frogs. We specifically asked whether the processes structuring leaf‐litter anuran assemblages in fragmented forests are the same as those in continuous forests. We analyzed anuran assemblages with respect to habitat characteristics, including fragmentation and degradation parameters. In comparison with continuous forests, species richness and diversity were lower and assemblage composition was altered in forest fragments. These changes seemed to be mainly caused by habitat degradation rather than forest fragmentation. Availability of aquatic sites for breeding, vegetation structure (including those variables indicating degradation), and leaf‐litter cover had the most influence on the presence of single species. The comparatively small impact of fragmentation on anurans might be due to the location of the study area; it still possessed large tracts of continuous forest.

We studied parameters of the anuran community living in the forest leaf litter in the Duas Bocas Biological Reserve (DBBR), Espírito Santo, Brazil. We sought to understand the extent to which richness, abundance, biomass and density varied between two locations with different stages of preservation (primary and secondary forest). In addition, we tested the effect of temperature and local humidity on abundance. We conducted the samplings monthly from October 2017 to September 2018, establishing 98 4 x 4 m plots (16 m <sup>2</sup> each) demarcated on the DBBR forest leaf litter. We measured temperature (°C) and relative air humidity (%), and each plot was carefully surveyed by four observers. We tested for differences in anuran density between the two sampled locations and estimated the effects of environmental variables in the community. We recorded 102 individuals of anurans from 11 species belonging to eight families. The DBBR anuran community parameters significantly differed between the two studied locations, with the highest values of anuran richness and abundance occurring in the area covered by primary forest, probably due to differences in the preservation of each area. However, temperature and humidity did not affect the abundance of anurans in the sampled areas. Our results provide the first information about spatial variation and influence of environmental factors, directed to the community of leaf litter anurans in DBBR, and represents the second study on this group of anurans in the state of Espírito Santo. </p>},

   abstract = {The Atlantic Forest presents high biodiversity, contrasting with its high degree of
fragmentation, intensified by the occurrence of highways. This paper aimed to
record direct and indirect influences of two highways on the richness,
abundance and spatial and temporal distributions of leaf litter anurans, as well
as to investigate the penetration of the noise caused by such highways in the
Reserva Biológica Saltinho (RBS), Pernambuco, Brazil. Eight pitfall trap lines
were installed: four along the margins of the highways and four inside the forest.
Traps were revised weekly from Jan/2010 to Jan/2011. Correlations with rainfall
and air temperature and humidity were tested calculating Spearman’s
correlation index. We compared the areas using Kruskal-Wallis and ANOSIM. A
total of 245 animals were recorded, belonging to 14 species. There was no
difference in the species composition between dry and rainy season, and no
correlation between population abundance and the abiotic variables tested.
Using an ANOSIM, we did not differentiate the area of the highways from areas
inside the forest. Twenty specimens of open area species were found dead on
the highway, being one of them the second record of its species for
Pernambuco. Road noise penetrates nearly 800 m into the forest, with higher
intensity up to 200 m from the highway margins, reducing between 200 and 800
m in a 1.5 dB/100 m. Beyond this threshold there was no influence caused by
the sound of the highways. Despite the similarity in the distribution of frogs, it is
not possible to say that the roads do not have negative effects on animals, in
view of the impossibility of dissociating the effects of other impacts suffered by
RBS. The low abundances found and the running over registered are
phenomena that are known as indirect and direct consequence of
the highway, respectively. Small forest fragments linked to streams (the case
of RBS) are considered important for the amphibian in highly
fragmented landscapes and roads are still to be observed carefully in order to
minimize mortality of them assignable and conservation of frogs that remains in
the place.
